Some of this uncertainty is structural, as most climate models neglect increasing meltwater from the Greenland ice sheet and do not explicitly capture mesoscale ocean eddies. Here, we quantify the impact of Greenland meltwater on the AMOC until 2100 under SSP5-8.5 forcing for the first time in a strongly eddying (1/10\u00b0 horizontal resolution) ocean model. The meltwater-induced additional AMOC weakening is small (0.6 $\\pm$ 0.2 Sv) compared to the weakening due to warming alone, and similar at high and low resolution. The same meltwater would cause a stronger AMOC weakening under present-day climate conditions. We link both resolution-independence and state-dependence to large-scale controls of the AMOC. Our results demonstrate that the background ocean state is more important than resolution in determining how Greenland meltwater affects the AMOC.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

Existing studies have primarily relied on aggregated, macroscopic traffic flow data to predict future traffic trends, whereas road traffic dynamics are also influenced by individual, microscopic human driving behaviors. Recent Connected Vehicle (CV) data provide rich driving behavior features, offering new opportunities to incorporate these behavioral insights into speed prediction. To this end, we propose the Macro-Micro Cross-Attention Transformer (MMCAformer) to integrate CV data-based micro driving behavior features with macro traffic features for speed prediction. Specifically, MMCAformer employs self-attention to learn intrinsic dependencies in macro traffic flow and cross-attention to capture spatiotemporal interplays between macro traffic status and micro driving behavior. MMCAformer is optimized with a Student-t negative log-likelihood loss to provide point-wise speed prediction and estimate uncertainty. Experiments on four Florida freeways demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed MMCAformer compared to baselines. Compared with only using macro features, introducing micro driving behavior features not only enhances prediction accuracy (e.g., overall RMSE, MAE, and MAPE reduced by 9.0%, 6.9%, and 10.2%, respectively) but also shrinks model prediction uncertainty (e.g., mean predictive intervals decreased by 10.1-24.0% across the four freeways).

While modern Vision-Language Models (VLM) have achieved high accuracy in this domain, they predominantly rely on autoregressive decoding, which becomes computationally expensive and slow for long documents as it requires a sequential forward pass for every generated token. We identify a key opportunity to overcome this bottleneck: unlike open-ended generation, OCR is a highly deterministic task where the visual input strictly dictates a unique output sequence, theoretically enabling efficient, parallel decoding via diffusion models. However, we show that existing masked diffusion models fail to harness this potential; those introduce structural instabilities that are benign in flexible tasks, like captioning, but catastrophic for the rigid, exact-match requirements of OCR. To bridge this gap, we introduce DODO, the first VLM to utilize block discrete diffusion and unlock its speedup potential for OCR. By decomposing generation into blocks, DODO mitigates the synchronization errors of global diffusion.

A dynamic spatiotemporal window is designed to extract real-time traffic flow and environmental features from primary crash locations and their upstream segments. The framework includes three models: a primary crash model to estimate the likelihood of secondary crash occurrence, and two secondary crash models to evaluate traffic conditions at crash and upstream segments under different comparative scenarios. An ensemble learning strategy integrating six machine learning algorithms is developed to enhance predictive performance, and a voting-based mechanism combines the outputs of the three models.

To probe loss-landscape geometry, we measure commutator defects -- the non-commutativity of successive gradient steps -- and project them onto this learned subspace. We find that curvature grows sharply in directions orthogonal to the execution subspace while the trajectory remains largely confined to it.

We develop a machine learning approach that corrects error growth in the argument of latitude for a diverse set of LEO satellites. The improved orbit propagation accuracy extends the applicability of the Gaussian assumption and modeling of the errors with a corrected mean and covariance. We compare the performance of a time-conditioned neural network and a Gaussian Process on datasets computed with an open source orbit propagator and publicly available Vector Covariance Message (VCM) ephemerides.

Existing methods often fail under strong detection or continuous fine-tuning, largely due to (1) cross-modal inconsistency that exposes trigger patterns and (2) gradient dilution at low poisoning rates that accelerates backdoor forgetting. These coupled causes remain insufficiently modeled and addressed. We propose BadCLIP++, a unified framework that tackles both challenges. For stealthiness, we introduce a semantic-fusion QR micro-trigger that embeds imperceptible patterns near task-relevant regions, preserving clean-data statistics while producing compact trigger distributions. We further apply target-aligned subset selection to strengthen signals at low injection rates. For persistence, we stabilize trigger embeddings via radius shrinkage and centroid alignment, and stabilize model parameters through curvature control and elastic weight consolidation, maintaining solutions within a low-curvature wide basin resistant to fine-tuning. We also provide the first theoretical analysis showing that, within a trust region, gradients from clean fine-tuning and backdoor objectives are co-directional, yielding a non-increasing upper bound on attack success degradation. Experiments demonstrate that with only 0.3% poisoning, BadCLIP++ achieves 99.99% attack success rate (ASR) in digital settings, surpassing baselines by 11.4 points.

Although recent monocular non-rigid SLAM methods have made notable progress, they often lack effective decoupling mechanisms and rely on sparse or low-fidelity scene representations, which leads to tracking drift and limited reconstruction quality. To address these limitations, we propose NRGS-SLAM, a monocular non-rigid SLAM system for endoscopy based on 3D Gaussian Splatting. To resolve the coupling ambiguity, we introduce a deformation-aware 3D Gaussian map that augments each Gaussian primitive with a learnable deformation probability, optimized via a Bayesian self-supervision strategy without requiring external non-rigidity labels. Building on this representation, we design a deformable tracking module that performs robust coarse-to-fine pose estimation by prioritizing low-deformation regions, followed by efficient per-frame deformation updates. A carefully designed deformable mapping module progressively expands and refines the map, balancing representational capacity and computational efficiency. In addition, a unified robust geometric loss incorporates external geometric priors to mitigate the inherent ill-posedness of monocular non-rigid SLAM. Extensive experiments on multiple public endoscopic datasets demonstrate that NRGS-SLAM achieves more accurate camera pose estimation (up to 50\\% reduction in RMSE) and higher-quality photo-realistic reconstructions than state-of-the-art methods.

We provide a general procedure to compute the exact worst-case regret of classical data-driven inventory policies, evaluated over all demand distributions. Our main technical result shows that this infinite-dimensional, non-convex optimization problem can be reduced to a finite-dimensional one, enabling an exact characterization of the performance of policies for any sample size and censoring levels. We leverage this reduction to derive sharp insights on the achievable performance of standard inventory policies under demand censoring. In particular, our analysis of the Kaplan-Meier policy shows that while demand censoring fundamentally limits what can be learned from passive sales data, just a small amount of targeted exploration at high inventory levels can substantially improve worst-case guarantees, enabling near-optimal performance even under heavy censoring. In contrast, when the point-of-sale system does not record stockout events and only reports realized sales, a natural and commonly used approach is to treat sales as demand.

Unlike most existing methods that rely primarily on entropy-based guidance to increase sample dissimilarity, we introduce Geometry-Aware Spherical Sampling (GASS) to enhance diversity by explicitly controlling both prompt-dependent and prompt-independent sources of variation. Specifically, we decompose the diversity measure in CLIP embeddings using two orthogonal directions: the text embedding, which captures semantic variation related to the prompt, and an identified orthogonal direction that captures prompt-independent variation (e.g., backgrounds). Based on this decomposition, GASS increases the geometric projection spread of generated image embeddings along both axes and guides the T2I sampling process via expanded predictions along the generation trajectory.

We bridge this gap by formalizing a diversification condition that emerges during training when overparametrized, consisting of two parts: phase symmetry and frequency diversification. We prove that these properties allow the network to collectively approximate a flawed indicator function on the correct logic for the modular addition task. While individual neurons produce noisy signals, the phase symmetry enables a majority-voting scheme that cancels out noise, allowing the network to robustly identify the correct sum. Furthermore, we explain the emergence of these features under random initialization via a lottery ticket mechanism. Our gradient flow analysis proves that frequencies compete within each neuron, with the \"winner\" determined by its initial spectral magnitude and phase alignment. From a technical standpoint, we provide a rigorous characterization of the layer-wise phase coupling dynamics and formalize the competitive landscape using the ODE comparison lemma.

TS of observations from natural or engineered systems almost always originate from some underlying DS, and arguably access to its governing equations would yield theoretically optimal forecasts. This is the promise of DS reconstruction (DSR), a class of ML/AI approaches that aim to infer surrogate models of the underlying DS from data. But models based on DS principles offer other profound advantages: Beyond short-term forecasts, they enable to predict the long-term statistics of an observed system, which in many practical scenarios may be the more relevant quantities.

Furthermore, a dual-discriminator framework is introduced, employing a temporal discriminator to enforce motion consistency alongside spatial realism. Experiments on the Digital Typhoon dataset for 4$\\times$ upscaling demonstrate that PESTGAN establishes a better performance in structural fidelity and perceptual quality. While maintaining competitive pixel-wise accuracy compared to existing approaches, our method significantly excels in reconstructing meteorologically plausible cloud structures with superior physical fidelity.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

Due to their complexity and prolonged duration, colorectal procedures have been underrepresented in current research. At the same time, they pose a particularly interesting learning environment due to repetitive tissue manipulation, making them a promising entry point for autonomous, machine learning-driven support. Therefore, in this work, we introduce attachment anchors, a structured representation that encodes the local geometric and mechanical relationships between tissue and its anatomical attachments in colorectal surgery. This representation reduces uncertainty in grasping point prediction by normalizing surgical scenes into a consistent local reference frame. We demonstrate that attachment anchors can be predicted from laparoscopic images and incorporated into a grasping framework based on machine learning. Experiments on a dataset of 90 colorectal surgeries demonstrate that attachment anchors improve grasping point prediction compared to image-only baselines. There are particularly strong gains in out-of-distribution settings, including unseen procedures and operating surgeons.

This undermines the model's ability to learn robust, generalizable features and results in poor performance on real-world data. Motivated by this discrepancy, we propose a novel method for generating high-quality tampered document images. We first train an auxiliary network to compare text crops, leveraging contrastive learning with a novel strategy for defining positive pairs and their corresponding negatives. We also train a second auxiliary network to evaluate whether a crop tightly encloses the intended characters, without cutting off parts of characters or including parts of adjacent ones. Using a carefully designed generation pipeline that leverages both networks, we introduce a framework capable of producing diverse, high-quality tampered document images. We assess the effectiveness of our data generation pipeline by training multiple models on datasets derived from the same source images, generated using our method and existing approaches, under identical training protocols.

Medical image registration is dominated by intensity-based registration methods that rely on surrogate measures of alignment quality. In contrast, feature-based approaches that operate by identifying explicit anatomical correspondences, while more desirable in theory, have largely fallen out of favor due to the challenges of reliably extracting features. However, such challenges are now significantly overcome thanks to recent advances in deep learning, which provide pre-trained segmentation models capable of instantly delivering reliable, fine-grained anatomical delineations. We aim to demonstrate that these advances can be leveraged to create new anatomically-grounded image registration algorithms. To this end, we propose Polaffini, which obtains, from these segmented regions, anatomically grounded feature points with 1-to-1 correspondence in a particularly simple way: extracting their centroids. These enable efficient global and local affine matching via closed-form solutions. Those are used to produce an overall transformation ranging from affine to polyaffine with tunable smoothness. Polyaffine transformations can have many more degrees of freedom than affine ones allowing for finer alignment, and their embedding in the log-Euclidean framework ensures diffeomorphic properties. Polaffini has applications both for standalone registration and as pre-alignment for subsequent non-linear registration, and we evaluate it against popular intensity-based registration techniques. Results demonstrate that Polaffini outperforms competing methods in terms of structural alignment and provides improved initialisation for downstream non-linear registration.

In this work, we establish that locality can also be a \\emph{policy-dependent} phenomenon. Our central contribution is a novel decomposition of the policy-induced interdependence matrix, $H^\u03c0$, which decouples the environment's sensitivity to state ($E^{\\mathrm{s}}$) and action ($E^{\\mathrm{a}}$) from the policy's sensitivity to state ($\u03a0(\u03c0)$). This decomposition reveals that locality can be induced by a smooth policy (small $\u03a0(\u03c0)$) even when the environment is strongly action-coupled, exposing a fundamental locality-optimality tradeoff. We use this framework to derive a general spectral condition $\u03c1(E^{\\mathrm{s}}+E^{\\mathrm{a}}\u03a0(\u03c0)) < 1$ for exponential decay, which is strictly tighter than prior norm-based conditions.

By replacing softmax attention with softmax-free retention and injecting multi-scale sequential priors, DRetHTR avoids a growing KV cache: decoding is linear in output length in both time and memory. To recover the local-to-global inductive bias of attention, we propose layer-wise gamma scaling, which progressively enlarges the effective retention horizon in deeper layers. This encourages early layers to model short-range dependencies and later layers to capture broader context, mitigating the flexibility gap introduced by removing softmax.

We present a concrete instantiation of this principle: a progressive alignment framework that iteratively identifies and ablates previously learned refusal directions, forcing the model to reconstruct safety along new, independent subspaces. Across four jailbreak attacks, we achieve the strongest overall robustness while mitigating over-refusal and preserving generation quality, with small computational overhead.

In this paper, we propose FATE (Forecasting Anomalies with Time-series Ensembles), a novel unsupervised framework for detecting Precursors-of-Anomaly (PoA) by quantifying predictive uncertainty from a diverse ensemble of time-series forecasting models. Unlike prior approaches that rely on reconstruction errors or require ground-truth labels, FATE anticipates future values and leverages ensemble disagreement to signal early signs of potential anomalies without access to target values at inference time. To rigorously evaluate PoA detection, we introduce Precursor Time-series Aware Precision and Recall (PTaPR), a new metric that extends the traditional Time-series Aware Precision and Recall (TaPR) by jointly assessing segment-level accuracy, within-segment coverage, and temporal promptness of early predictions. This enables a more holistic assessment of early warning capabilities that existing metrics overlook. Experiments on five real-world benchmark datasets show that FATE achieves an average improvement of 19.9 percentage points in PTaPR AUC and 20.02 percentage points in early detection F1 score, outperforming baselines while requiring no anomaly labels.

However, training remains challenging due to the lack of reliable, verifiable reward signals that can reflect the inherently subjective nature of creative editing. In this work, we introduce RetouchIQ, a framework that performs instruction-based executable image editing through MLLM agents guided by a generalist reward model. RetouchIQ interprets user-specified editing intentions and generates corresponding, executable image adjustments, bridging high-level aesthetic goals with precise parameter control.

We curate an extended dataset with 190k instruction-reasoning pairs and establish a new benchmark for instruction-based image editing.

Motivated by these gaps, we introduce ArtSound, a large-scale multimodal dataset of 105,884 artwork-music pairs enriched with dual-modality captions, obtained by extending ArtGraph and the Free Music Archive. We further propose ArtToMus, the first framework explicitly designed for direct artwork-to-music generation, which maps digitized artworks to music without image-to-text translation or language-based semantic supervision.

Experimental results show that ArtToMus generates musically coherent and stylistically consistent outputs that reflect salient visual cues of the source artworks. While absolute alignment scores remain lower than those of text-conditioned systems-as expected given the substantially increased difficulty of removing linguistic supervision-ArtToMus achieves competitive perceptual quality and meaningful cross-modal correspondence.

However, existing unlearning approaches commonly suffer from a fundamental trade-off: aggressively erasing the influence of target data often degrades model utility on retained data, while conservative strategies leave residual target information intact. In this work, the intrinsic representation properties learned during model pretraining are analyzed. It is demonstrated that semantic class concepts are entangled at the feature-pattern level, sharing associated features while preserving concept-specific discriminative components. This entanglement fundamentally limits the effectiveness of existing unlearning paradigms. Motivated by this insight, we propose Machine-Guided Unlearning (MeGU), a novel framework that guides unlearning through concept-aware re-alignment. Specifically, Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs) are leveraged to explicitly determine re-alignment directions for target samples by assigning semantically meaningful perturbing labels. To improve efficiency, inter-class conceptual similarities estimated by the MLLM are encoded into a lightweight transition matrix. Furthermore, MeGU introduces a positive-negative feature noise pair to explicitly disentangle target concept influence. During finetuning, the negative noise suppresses target-specific feature patterns, while the positive noise reinforces remaining associated features and aligns them with perturbing concepts. This coordinated design enables selective disruption of target-specific representations while preserving shared semantic structures. As a result, MeGU enables controlled and selective forgetting, effectively mitigating both under-unlearning and over-unlearning.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

Modeling this ability has been a longstanding goal for the science and engineering of visual intelligence, yet decades of computational methods have fallen short of human performance. Here we develop a modeling framework that predicts human 3D shape inferences for arbitrary objects, directly from experimental stimuli. We achieve this with a novel class of neural networks trained using a visual-spatial objective over naturalistic sensory data; given a set of images taken from different locations within a natural scene, these models learn to predict spatial information related to these images, such as camera location and visual depth, without relying on any object-related inductive biases. Notably, these visual-spatial signals are analogous to sensory cues readily available to humans. We design a zero-shot evaluation approach to determine the performance of these `multi-view' models on a well established 3D perception task, then compare model and human behavior. Our modeling framework is the first to match human accuracy on 3D shape inferences, even without task-specific training or fine-tuning. Remarkably, independent readouts of model responses predict fine-grained measures of human behavior, including error patterns and reaction times, revealing a natural correspondence between model dynamics and human perception.

To systematically study it, we introduce LIBERO-CF, the first counterfactual benchmark for VLAs that evaluates language following capability by assigning alternative instructions under visually plausible LIBERO layouts. Our evaluation reveals that counterfactual failures are prevalent yet underexplored across state-of-the-art VLAs.

Federated learning (FL) further facilitates this process by enabling collaborative fine-tuning across distributed clients without sharing private data.

The first challenge arises from the error induced by separately aggregating those two low-rank matrices. The second challenge occurs even when the product of two low-rank matrices is aggregated. The server needs to recover factors via matrix decomposition, which is non-unique and can introduce decomposition drift. To tackle the aforementioned challenges, we propose FLoRG, a federated fine-tuning framework which employs a single low-rank matrix for fine-tuning and aggregates its Gram matrix (i.e., the matrix of inner products of its column vectors), eliminating the aggregation error while also reducing the communication overhead. FLoRG minimizes the decomposition drift by introducing a Procrustes alignment approach which aligns the decomposed matrix between consecutive fine-tuning rounds for consistent updates. We theoretically analyze the convergence of FLoRG and prove that adopting the Procrustes alignment results in a tighter convergence bound. Experimental results across multiple LLM fine-tuning benchmarks demonstrate that FLoRG outperforms five state-of-the-art baseline schemes in the downstream task accuracy and can reduce the communication overhead by up to 2041$\\times$.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

Extensive experiments on large language models (LLMs) and vision transformers (ViTs) demonstrate that ZO-Muon significantly accelerates convergence and achieves a win-win improvement in accuracy and query/runtime efficiency. Notably, compared to the popular MeZO baseline, ZO-Muon requires only 24.7% of the queries to reach the same SST-2 performance for LLM fine-tuning, and improves accuracy by 25.1% on ViT-B fine-tuning on CIFAR-100.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

While deep reinforcement learning (DRL) combined with domain randomization has shown promise in mitigating the sim-to-real gap, simultaneously handling all sources of uncertainty often leads to sub-optimal policies and poor learning efficiency. This study formulates a new curriculum-based continual learning framework for robust control problems involving nonlinear dynamical systems in which multiple sources of uncertainty are simultaneously superimposed. The key idea is to decompose a complex control problem with multiple uncertainties into a sequence of continual learning tasks, in which strategies for handling each uncertainty are acquired sequentially. The original system is extended into a finite set of plants whose dynamic uncertainties are gradually expanded and diversified as learning progresses. The policy is stably updated across the entire plant sets associated with tasks defined by different uncertainty configurations without catastrophic forgetting. To ensure learning efficiency, we jointly incorporate a model-based controller (MBC), which guarantees a shared baseline performance across the plant sets, into the learning process to accelerate the convergence. This residual learning scheme facilitates task-specific optimization of the DRL agent for each uncertainty, thereby enhancing sample efficiency. As a practical industrial application, this study applies the proposed method to designing an active vibration controller for automotive powertrains.

Theoretical analyses of this sampling scheme (Feldman & Shenfeld, 2025; Dong et al., 2025) lead to bounds that are close to those of Poisson sampling, yet still have two significant shortcomings. First, in many practical settings, the resulting privacy parameters are not tight due to the approximation steps in the analysis. Second, the computed parameters are either the hockey stick or Renyi divergence, both of which introduce overheads when used in privacy loss accounting.\n  In this work, we demonstrate that the privacy loss distribution (PLD) of random allocation applied to any differentially private algorithm can be computed efficiently. When applied to the Gaussian mechanism, our results demonstrate that the privacy-utility trade-off for random allocation is at least as good as that of Poisson subsampling. In particular, random allocation is better suited for training via DP-SGD.

In this work, we propose to leverage pretrained knowledge from large language models (LLMs) to transform sparse rewards into dense training signals (i.e., the advantage function) through retrospective in-context learning (RICL). We further propose an online learning framework, RICOL, which iteratively refines the policy based on the credit assignment results from RICL. We empirically demonstrate that RICL can accurately estimate the advantage function with limited samples and effectively identify critical states in the environment for temporal credit assignment. Extended evaluation on four BabyAI scenarios show that RICOL achieves comparable convergent performance with traditional online RL algorithms with significantly higher sample efficiency. Our findings highlight the potential of leveraging LLMs for temporal credit assignment, paving the way for more sample-efficient and generalizable RL paradigms.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

In this paper, we revisit weight regularization in low-rank CL as a new perspective for mitigating task interference in PECL.

If so, what form does it take, and does it hold uniformly across modalities?

To address this challenge, we introduce FAMOSE (Feature AugMentation and Optimal Selection agEnt), a novel framework that leverages the ReAct paradigm to autonomously explore, generate, and refine features while integrating feature selection and evaluation tools within an agent architecture. To our knowledge, FAMOSE represents the first application of an agentic ReAct framework to automated feature engineering, especially for both regression and classification tasks. Extensive experiments demonstrate that FAMOSE is at or near the state-of-the-art on classification tasks (especially tasks with more than 10K instances, where ROC-AUC increases 0.23% on average), and achieves the state-of-the-art for regression tasks by reducing RMSE by 2.0% on average, while remaining more robust to errors than other algorithms. We hypothesize that FAMOSE's strong performance is because ReAct allows the LLM context window to record (via iterative feature discovery and evaluation steps) what features did or did not work. This is similar to a few-shot prompt and guides the LLM to invent better, more innovative features. Our work offers evidence that AI agents are remarkably effective in solving problems that require highly inventive solutions, such as feature engineering.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

Experimental evaluation yielded 90% overall precision, 82.2% mean average precision (mAP), and 84% sortation purity.

We adopt a human centric view governed by two principles: counterfactual harm, ensuring the AI does not undermine human strengths, and complementarity, ensuring it adds value where the human is prone to err. We formalize these concepts via user defined rules, allowing users to specify exactly what harm and complementarity mean for their specific task. We then introduce an online, distribution free algorithm with finite sample guarantees that enforces the user-specified constraints over the collaboration dynamics. We evaluate our framework across two interactive settings: LLM simulated collaboration on a medical diagnostic task and a human crowdsourcing study on a pictorial reasoning task. We show that our online procedure maintains prescribed counterfactual harm and complementarity violation rates even under nonstationary interaction dynamics. Moreover, tightening or loosening these constraints produces predictable shifts in downstream human accuracy, confirming that the two principles serve as practical levers for steering multi-round collaboration toward better decision quality without the need to model or constrain human behavior.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

However, training reliable reward models relies heavily on human-labeled preference data, which is costly and limited, motivating the use of data augmentation. Existing augmentation approaches typically operate at the representation or semantic level and remain agnostic to the reward model's estimation difficulty. In this paper, we propose MARS, an adaptive, margin-aware augmentation and sampling strategy that explicitly targets ambiguous and failure modes of the reward model. Our proposed framework, MARS, concentrates augmentation on low-margin (ambiguous) preference pairs where the reward model is most uncertain, and iteratively refines the training distribution via hard-sample augmentation. We provide theoretical guarantees showing that this strategy increases the average curvature of the loss function hence enhance information and improves conditioning, along with empirical results demonstrating consistent gains over uniform augmentation for robust reward modeling.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}
