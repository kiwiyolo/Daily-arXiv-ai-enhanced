The model is trained using 0.25-degree, 3-hourly ERA5 as forcings and CONUS404 as targets in 1980--2019, producing 4-km, hourly dynamical downscaling outputs; it is also connected to a post-processing model to derive additional diagnostic variables. The model is evaluated across multiple forcing datasets, time periods, and climate regimes. For present-day downscaling in the 2021--2024 water years, the model produces stable multi-year simulations with no unrealistic drift; its deterministic verification scores are comparable to other weather-forecasting-oriented AI models. The model also generalizes robustly to a 1.0-degree, 6-hourly non-ERA5 forcing dataset, yielding only minor performance changes. Frontal cyclone and hurricane case studies further demonstrate that the model reconstructs realistic, interpretable weather-scale dynamical and thermodynamic structure from coarse boundary information. The AI-based LAM is further tested by downscaling 30-year global climate model runs in 1980--2010 and 2070--2100, and climate model ensembles in 2025-2027. In this application, the model remains stable at hourly downscaling frequencies for all 30 years and effectively captures future climate-change signals, indicating meaningful generalization across different climate regimes. When downscaling ensembles, the model produces well-posed ensemble distributions without collapsing the ensemble spread. Overall, the AI-based LAM of this study offers good downscaling performance and generalization abilities. It provides a practical and transferable example of adapting AI weather prediction models for regional climate applications."}

In this study, the internal variability leveraging (IVL) approach is used to transpose an atmospheric river cluster that affected the U.S. West Coast during 20-29 October 2021. Steering the storm toward the target basin and determining its transposition region are achieved by considering an ensemble of plausible storm evolutions and trajectories obtained from archived ECMWF medium-range forecasts. The Willamette River and Nass River watersheds, located approximately 6 deg N, 2 deg W and 16 deg N, 8 deg W, respectively, from the area most affected by the observed precipitation, were selected as target basins. For each basin, the IVL realization yielding the largest 24-h basin-average precipitation depth was identified, and the initial and boundary condition shifting method was subsequently applied to further enhance its impact, producing 24-h precipitation depths of 119 mm for the Willamette and 98 mm for the Nass."}

Building upon the decomposition of the time series, we enhance the architecture of machine learning models for better multivariate time series forecasting.

Recognizing that reversible instance normalization is effective only for the trend component, we take a different approach with the seasonal component by directly applying backbone models without any normalization or scaling procedures. Through these strategies, we successfully reduce error values of the existing state-of-the-art models and finally introduce dual-MLP models as more computationally efficient solutions. Furthermore, our approach consistently yields positive results with around 10% MSE average reduction across four state-of-the-art baselines on the benchmark datasets.

However, clinical decision making is largely informed by static, population based NTCP models which overlook the dynamic, unique biological trajectories encoded in sequential data. We developed COMPASS (Comprehensive Personalized Assessment System) for safe radiotherapy, functioning as a temporal digital twin architecture utilizing per fraction PET, CT, dosiomics, radiomics, and cumulative biologically equivalent dose (BED) kinetics to model normal tissue biology as a dynamic time series process. A GRU autoencoder was employed to learn organ specific latent trajectories, which were classified via logistic regression to predict eventual CTCAE grade 1 or higher toxicity. Eight NSCLC patients undergoing BGRT contributed to the 99 organ fraction observations covering 24 organ trajectories (spinal cord, heart, and esophagus). Despite the small cohort, intensive temporal phenotyping allowed for comprehensive analysis of individual dose response dynamics. Our findings revealed a viable AI driven early warning window, as increasing risk ratings occurred from several fractions before clinical toxicity. The dense BED driven representation revealed biologically relevant spatial dose texture characteristics that occur before toxicity and are averaged out with traditional volume based dosimetry.

While imaging modalities such as Computed Tomography provide high-quality 3D data, 2D ultrasound (2D-US) remains the preferred first-line modality for breast and thyroid imaging due to cost, portability, and safety factors. However, volume estimates derived from 2D-US suffer from high inter-user variability even among experienced clinicians. Existing 3D ultrasound (3D-US) solutions use specialized probes or external tracking hardware, but such configurations increase costs and diminish portability, constraining widespread clinical use. To address these limitations, we present Mobile Augmented Reality Volumetric Ultrasound (MARVUS), a resource-efficient system designed to increase accessibility to accurate and reproducible volumetric assessment. MARVUS is interoperable with conventional ultrasound (US) systems, using a foundation model to enhance cross-specialty generalization while minimizing hardware requirements relative to current 3D-US solutions. In a user study involving experienced clinicians performing measurements on breast phantoms, MARVUS yielded a substantial improvement in volume estimation accuracy (mean difference: 0.469 cm3) with reduced inter-user variability (mean difference: 0.417 cm3). Additionally, we prove that augmented reality (AR) visualizations enhance objective performance metrics and clinician-reported usability.

MedTS data typically exhibit two critical patterns: temporal dependencies within individual channels and channel dependencies across multiple channels. While recent advances in deep learning have leveraged Transformer-based models to effectively capture temporal dependencies, they often struggle with modeling channel dependencies. This limitation stems from a structural mismatch: MedTS signals are inherently centralized, whereas the Transformer's attention mechanism is decentralized, making it less effective at capturing global synchronization and unified waveform patterns. To address this mismatch, we propose CoTAR (Core Token Aggregation-Redistribution), a centralized MLP-based module designed to replace decentralized attention. Instead of allowing all tokens to interact directly, as in standard attention, CoTAR introduces a global core token that serves as a proxy to facilitate inter-token interactions, thereby enforcing a centralized aggregation and redistribution strategy. This design not only better aligns with the centralized nature of MedTS signals but also reduces computational complexity from quadratic to linear. Experiments on five benchmarks validate the superiority of our method in both effectiveness and efficiency, achieving up to a 12.13% improvement on the APAVA dataset, while using only 33% of the memory and 20% of the inference time compared to the previous state of the art.

This poses risks in clinical settings, where models must generalize across institutions, populations, and acquisition conditions. Feature disentanglement is a promising approach to mitigate shortcut learning by separating task-relevant information from confounder-related features in latent representations. In this study, we systematically evaluated feature disentanglement methods for mitigating shortcuts in medical imaging, including adversarial learning and latent space splitting based on dependence minimization. We assessed classification performance and disentanglement quality using latent space analyses across one artificial and two medical datasets with natural and synthetic confounders. We also examined robustness under varying levels of confounding and compared computational efficiency across methods. We found that shortcut mitigation methods improved classification performance under strong spurious correlations during training. Latent space analyses revealed differences in representation quality not captured by classification metrics, highlighting the strengths and limitations of each method. Model reliance on shortcuts depended on the degree of confounding in the training data. The best-performing models combine data-centric rebalancing with model-centric disentanglement, achieving stronger and more robust shortcut mitigation than rebalancing alone while maintaining similar computational efficiency."}

Robust covariance estimators like M-estimators or Tyler's estimator address this issue, but still struggle when thermal noise combines with clutter. To overcome these challenges, we investigate the use of Support Vector Data Description (SVDD) and its deep extension, Deep SVDD, for target detection. These one-class learning methods avoid direct noise covariance estimation and are adapted here as CFAR detectors.

Machine unlearning has been proposed to address this challenge. However, current evaluations for unlearning methods rely on output-based metrics, which cannot verify whether information is completely deleted or merely suppressed at the representation level, where suppression is insufficient for true unlearning. To address this gap, we propose a novel restoration-based analysis framework that uses Sparse Autoencoders to identify class-specific expert features in intermediate layers and applies inference-time steering to quantitatively distinguish between suppression and deletion. Applying our framework to 12 major unlearning methods in image classification tasks, we find that most methods achieve high restoration rates of unlearned information, indicating that they only suppress information at the decision-boundary level, while preserving semantic features in intermediate representations. Notably, even retraining from pretrained checkpoints shows high restoration, revealing that robust semantic features inherited from pretraining are not removed by retraining. These results demonstrate that representation-level retention poses significant risks overlooked by output-based metrics, highlighting the need for new unlearning evaluation criteria. We propose new evaluation guidelines that prioritize representation-level verification, especially for privacy-critical applications in the era of pre-trained models."}

However, strong-form evolutionary approaches can yield ill-conditioned linear systems due to pointwise residual discretization, and their computational cost scales unfavorably with the number of training samples. To address these limitations, we propose a weak-form evolutionary Kolmogorov-Arnold Network (KAN) for the scalable and accurate prediction of PDE solutions. We decouple the linear system size from the number of training samples through the weak formulation, leading to improved scalability compared to strong-form approaches. We also rigorously enforce boundary conditions by constructing the trial space with boundary-constrained KANs to satisfy Dirichlet and periodic conditions, and by incorporating derivative boundary conditions directly into the weak formulation for Neumann conditions. In conclusion, the proposed weak-form evolutionary KAN framework provides a stable and scalable approach for PDEs and contributes to scientific machine learning with potential relevance to future engineering applications."}

Our probabilistic field-of-view and occlusion models incorporate head and shoulder rotation angles to create speed-dependent vision maps for individual players in a two-dimensional top-down plane. We combine these vision maps with pitch control and pitch value surfaces to analyze the awaiting phase (when a player is awaiting the ball to arrive after a pass for a teammate) and their subsequent on-ball phase. We demonstrate that aggregated visual metrics - such as the percentage of defended area observed while awaiting a pass - are predictive of controlled pitch value gained at the end of dribbling actions using 32 games of synchronized pose-enhanced tracking data and on-ball event data from the 2024 Copa America. This methodology works regardless of player position, eliminates manual annotation requirements, and provides continuous measurements that seamlessly integrate into existing soccer analytics frameworks. To further support the integration with existing soccer analytics frameworks we open-source the tools required to make these calculations."}

We present a controlled evaluation of synthetic augmentation for YOLOv11 across three single-class detection regimes -- Traffic Signs (sparse/near-saturated), Cityscapes Pedestrian (dense/occlusion-heavy), and COCO PottedPlant (multi-instance/high-variability). We benchmark six GAN-, diffusion-, and hybrid-based generators over augmentation ratios from 10% to 150% of the real training split, and train YOLOv11 both from scratch and with COCO-pretrained initialization, evaluating on held-out real test splits (mAP@0.50:0.95). For each dataset-generator-augmentation configuration, we compute pre-training dataset metrics under a matched-size bootstrap protocol, including (i) global feature-space metrics in both Inception-v3 and DINOv2 embeddings and (ii) object-centric distribution distances over bounding-box statistics. Synthetic augmentation yields substantial gains in the more challenging regimes (up to +7.6% and +30.6% relative mAP in Pedestrian and PottedPlant, respectively) but is marginal in Traffic Signs and under pretrained fine-tuning. To separate metric signal from augmentation quantity, we report both raw and augmentation-controlled (residualized) correlations with multiple-testing correction, showing that metric-performance alignment is strongly regime-dependent and that many apparent raw associations weaken after controlling for augmentation level."}

This paper presents a novel, explainable, and individualized approach for stress prediction using physiological data from consumer-grade smartwatches. We develop a time series forecasting model that leverages multivariate features, including heart rate variability, activity patterns, and sleep metrics, to predict stress levels across 16 temporal horizons (History window: 3, 5, 7, 9 days; forecasting window: 1, 3, 5, 7 days). Our evaluation involves 16 participants monitored for 10-15 weeks. We evaluate our approach across 16 participants, comparing against state-of-the-art time series models (Informer, TimesNet, PatchTST) and traditional baselines (CNN, LSTM, CNN-LSTM) across multiple temporal horizons. Our model achieved performance with an MSE of 0.053, MAE of 0.190, and RMSE of 0.226 in optimal settings (5-day input, 1-day prediction). A comparison with the baseline models shows that our model outperforms TimesNet, PatchTST, CNN-LSTM, LSTM, and CNN under all conditions, representing improvements of 36.9%, 25.5%, and 21.5% over the best baseline. According to the explanability analysis, sleep metrics are the most dominant and consistent stress predictors (importance: 1.1, consistency: 0.9-1.0), while activity features exhibit high inter-participant variability (0.1-0.2). Most notably, the model captures individual-specific patterns where identical features can have opposing effects across users, validating its personalization capabilities.

We extend geometric analysis to multi-task modular arithmetic, training shared-trunk Transformers on dual-task (mod-add + mod-mul) and tri-task (mod-add + mod-mul + mod-sq) objectives across a systematic weight decay sweep. Five consistent phenomena emerge. (1) Staggered grokking order: multiplication generalizes first, followed by squaring, then addition, with consistent delays across seeds. (2) Universal integrability: optimization trajectories remain confined to an empirically invariant low-dimensional execution manifold; commutator defects orthogonal to this manifold reliably precede generalization. (3) Weight decay phase structure: grokking timescale, curvature depth, reconstruction threshold, and defect lead covary systematically with weight decay, revealing distinct dynamical regimes and a sharp no-decay failure mode. (4) Holographic incompressibility: final solutions occupy only 4--8 principal trajectory directions yet are distributed across full-rank weights and destroyed by minimal perturbations; SVD truncation, magnitude pruning, and uniform scaling all fail to preserve performance. (5) Transverse fragility and redundancy: removing less than 10% of orthogonal gradient components eliminates grokking, yet dual-task models exhibit partial recovery under extreme deletion, suggesting redundant center manifolds enabled by overparameterization.

While previous works have tackled this problem, we find that SOTA methods suffer from catastrophic forgetting, where the model's performance drops well below the source model due to continual parameter updates at test-time. In this work, we first show that adapting only the modality fusion layer to a target domain not only improves performance on that domain but can also enhance performance on subsequent domains. Based on this strong cross-task transferability of the fusion layer's parameters, we propose a method, $\\texttt{AV-CTTA}$, that improves test-time performance of the models without access to any source data. Our approach works by using a selective parameter retrieval mechanism that dynamically retrieves the best fusion layer parameters from a buffer using only a small batch of test data. These parameters are then integrated into the model, adapted to the current test distribution, and saved back for future use. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets involving unimodal and bimodal corruptions show our proposed $\\texttt{AV-CTTA}$ significantly outperforms existing methods while minimizing catastrophic forgetting."}

Although Reinforcement Learning (RL) has been proposed for solving Optimal Power Flow (OPF) problems, the requirement for iterative interaction with an environment often necessitates computationally expensive simulators, leading to significant sample inefficiency. In this study, these challenges are addressed through the use of Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs), which can replace conventional and costly smart grid simulators. The RL policy learning process is enhanced so that convergence can be achieved in a fraction of the time required by the original environment. The PINN-based surrogate is compared with other benchmark data-driven surrogate models. By incorporating knowledge of the underlying physical laws, the results show that the PINN surrogate is the only approach considered in this context that can obtain a strong RL policy even without access to samples from the true simulator. The results demonstrate that using PINN surrogates can accelerate training by 50% compared to RL training without a surrogate. This approach enables the rapid generation of performance scores similar to those produced by the original simulator."}

A self-distillation loop (generating synthetic images from descriptor prompts, then training a LoRA on those outputs) achieves consistent convergence toward a specific identity as measured by ArcFace similarity. The trained LoRA creates a local coordinate system shaping not only the target identity but also its inverse: maximal away-conditioning produces eldritch'' structural breakdown in base SD1.5, while the LoRA-equipped model produces ``uncanny valley'' outputs -- coherent but precisely wrong. In Study~2, we extend this to prompt-level morphology. Drawing on phonestheme theory, we generate 200 novel nonsense words from English sound-symbolic clusters (e.g., \\emph{cr-}, \\emph{sn-}, \\emph{-oid}, \\emph{-ax}) and find that phonestheme-bearing candidates produce significantly more visually coherent outputs than random controls (mean Purity@1 = 0.371 vs.\\ 0.209, p<0.00001p < 0.00001 p<0.00001, Cohen's d=0.55d = 0.55 d=0.55).

Using over 350,000 transactions from Dubai Land Department (2015-2025), we construct weekly price indices for 19 sub-city regions and evaluate forecasts from 2 to 34 weeks ahead. Our framework fuses regional transaction history with Sentinel-1 SAR backscatter, news sentiment combining lexical tone and semantic embeddings, and macroeconomic context. Results are strongly horizon dependent: at horizons up to 10 weeks, price history alone matches multimodal configurations, but beyond 14 weeks sentiment and SAR become critical. At long horizons (26-34 weeks), the full multimodal model reduces mean absolute error from 4.48 to 2.93 (35% reduction), with gains statistically significant across regions.

This paradigm has been extraordinarily successful for well-defined tasks where goals are fixed and evaluation criteria are explicit. However, if artificial systems are to move toward true autonomy-operating over long horizons and across evolving contexts-objectives may become ill-defined, shifting, or entirely absent. In such settings, a fundamental question emerges: in the absence of an explicit objective function, how can a system determine whether its ongoing internal dynamics are productive or pathological? And how should it regulate structural change without external supervision? In this work, we propose a dynamical framework for learning without an explicit objective. Instead of minimizing external error signals, the system evaluates the intrinsic health of its own internal dynamics and regulates structural plasticity accordingly. We introduce a two-timescale architecture that separates fast state evolution from slow structural adaptation, coupled through an internally generated stress variable that accumulates evidence of persistent dynamical dysfunction. Structural modification is then triggered not continuously, but as a state-dependent event. Through a minimal toy model, we demonstrate that this stress-regulated mechanism produces temporally segmented, self-organized learning episodes without reliance on externally defined goals. Our results suggest a possible route toward autonomous learning systems capable of self-assessment and internally regulated structural reorganization."}

In practice, influence is often measured through the effect of an example on parameter updates. To make selection scalable, many approaches leverage optimizer statistics (e.g., Adam states) as an axis-aligned surrogate for update geometry (i.e., diagonal precondition), implicitly treating parameters as coordinate-wise independent. We show that this assumption breaks down in parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) methods such as LoRA. In this setting, the induced optimization geometry exhibits strong cross-parameter coupling with non-trivial off-diagonal interactions, while the task-relevant update directions are confined to a low-dimensional subspace. Motivated by this mismatch, we propose GIST (Gradient Isometric Subspace Transformation), a simple yet principled alternative that replaces axis-aligned scaling with robust subspace alignment. GIST recovers a task-specific subspace from validation gradients via spectral filtering (SVD), projects training gradients into this coupled subspace, and scores examples by their alignment with target directions.Extensive experiments have demonstrated that GIST matches or outperforms the state-of-the-art baseline with only 0.29% of the storage and 25% of the computational time under the same selection budget."}

In this paper, we propose ETAP (Ensemble Task Affinity Predictor), a scalable framework that integrates principled and data-driven estimators to predict MTL performance gains. First, we consider the gradient-based updates of shared parameters in an MTL model to measure the affinity between a pair of tasks as the similarity between the parameter updates based on these tasks. This linear estimator, which we call affinity score, naturally extends to estimating affinity within a group of tasks. Second, to refine these estimates, we train predictors that apply non-linear transformations and correct residual errors, capturing complex and non-linear task relationships. We train these predictors on a limited number of task groups for which we obtain ground-truth gain values via multi-task learning for each group.

The benchmark encompasses two scenarios: Metromap, covering metro networks in 160 cities across 52 countries, and Travelmap, depicting 168 representative tourist attractions from 19 countries. In total, MapTab comprises 328 images, 196,800 route planning queries, and 3,936 QA queries, all incorporating 4 key constraints: Time, Price, Comfort, and Reliability. Extensive evaluations across 15 representative MLLMs reveal that current models face substantial challenges in constrained multimodal reasoning. Notably, under conditions of limited visual perception, multimodal collaboration often underperforms compared to unimodal approaches. We believe MapTab provides a challenging and realistic testbed to advance the systematic evaluation of MLLMs."}

This setup couples ranking behavior with retrieval quality, so differences in output cannot be attributed to the ranking policy alone. We introduce a controlled diagnostic that isolates reranking by using Multi-News clusters as fixed evidence pools. We limit each pool to exactly eight documents and pass identical inputs to all rankers. Within this setup, BM25 and MMR serve as interpretable reference points for lexical matching and diversity optimization. Across 345 clusters, we find that redundancy patterns vary by model: one LLM implicitly diversifies at larger selection budgets, while another increases redundancy. In contrast, LLMs underperform on lexical coverage at small selection budgets. As a result, LLM rankings diverge substantially from both baselines rather than consistently approximating either strategy. By eliminating retrieval variance, we can attribute these differences directly to the ranking policy. This diagnostic is model-agnostic and applicable to any ranker, including open source systems and proprietary APIs."}

The problem is none of these provide a structural guarantee against forgetting. In this work, we propose Non-Interfering Weight Fields (NIWF), a framework that replaces the fixed weight paradigm with a learned function that generates weight configurations on demand from a continuous capability coordinate space. After training on a task, we commit the occupied coordinate region by snapshotting the fields outputs on anchor points to enforce a functional lock during all future training. We validate NIWF on sequential instructionfollowing and code generation tasks using Mistral-7B, demonstrating zero forgetting on committed tasks with competitive perplexity on new tasks.

While fine-tuning is a commonly adopted mitigation strategy, its high computational cost and practical difficulty motivate the need for training-free alternatives, among which model editing has recently emerged as a promising direction. However, indiscriminate editing risks disrupting the rich implicit knowledge encoded in pre-trained LVLMs, leading to a fundamental question: how much intervention is necessary at each layer to suppress hallucinations while preserving pre-trained knowledge? To address this question, we present a systematic analysis of LVLM decoders built on three widely used large language model backbones-Qwen, LLaMA, and Vicuna-revealing clear layer-wise differences in susceptibility to object hallucination. Building on these insights, we introduce the Hallucination Insensitivity Score (HIS), a principled metric that quantifies each layer's sensitivity to hallucination and provides guidance for targeted intervention. Leveraging HIS, we propose Hallucination Insensitivity Model Editing (HIME), a simple yet effective layer-adaptive weight editing approach that selectively modifies latent features to suppress hallucinations while preserving pre-trained knowledge. Extensive experiments demonstrate that HIME reduces hallucinations by an average of 61.8% across open-ended generation benchmarks, including CHAIR, MME, and GPT-4V-aided evaluation, without introducing additional parameters, inference-time latency, or computational overhead."}

These include visual variations such as background changes and distractors that are irrelevant to the task being solved. We address this limitation by augmenting the predictive objective with a bisimulation encoder that enforces control-relevant state equivalence, mapping states with similar transition dynamics to nearby latent states while limiting contributions from slow features. We evaluate our model on a simple navigation task under different test-time background changes and visual distractors. Across all benchmarks, our model consistently improves robustness to slow features while operating in a reduced latent space, up to 10x smaller than that of DINO-WM.

We introduce ARTIST, which formulates time-series reasoning as a sequential decision problem. ARTIST interleaves reasoning with adaptive temporal segment selection. It adopts a controller-reasoner architecture and uses reinforcement learning to train the controller role to select informative segments and the reasoner role to generate segment-conditioned reasoning traces and final answers. During inference, the model actively acquires task-relevant information instead of relying on a static summary of the full sequence. We use a novel hierarchical policy optimization approach for post-training that allows the model to excel in both segment selection and question-answering behavior. We evaluate ARTIST on six time-series reasoning benchmarks and compare it with large language models, vision-language models, and prior time-series reasoning systems. ARTIST improves average accuracy by 6.46 absolute percentage points over the strongest baseline. The largest gains appear on rare event localization and multi-segment reasoning tasks. Supervised fine-tuning improves performance, and reinforcement learning provides additional gains by optimizing question-adaptive segment selection.

Based on these insight, we introduce InfoNoise, a principled data-adaptive training noise schedule that replaces heuristic schedule design with an information-guided noise sampling distribution derived from entropy-reduction rates estimated from denoising losses already computed during training. Across natural-image benchmarks, InfoNoise matches or surpasses tuned EDM-style schedules, in some cases with a substantial training speedup (about $1.4\\times$ on CIFAR-10).

Existing VLMs often produce plausible yet ungrounded answers, and even when prompted to \"reflect\", their corrections may remain detached from the image evidence. To address this, we propose the MIRROR framework for Multimodal Iterative Reasoning via Reflection On visual Regions. By embedding visual reflection as a core mechanism, MIRROR is formulated as a closed-loop process comprising draft, critique, region-based verification, and revision, which are repeated until the output is visually grounded. To facilitate training of this model, we construct **ReflectV**, a visual reflective dataset for multi-turn supervision that explicitly contains reflection triggers, region-based verification actions, and answer revision grounded in visual evidence. Experiments on both general vision-language benchmarks and representative vision-language reasoning benchmarks show that MIRROR improves correctness and reduces visual hallucinations, demonstrating the value of training reflection as an evidence-seeking, region-aware verification process rather than a purely textual revision step."}

This phenomenon, in-context learning, challenges conventional understanding of learning and adaptation in physical systems. Here, we study in-context learning of dynamical systems in a minimal setting: we train a small two-layer, single-head transformer to forecast one dynamical system, and then evaluate its ability to forecast a different dynamical system without retraining. We discover an early tradeoff in training between in-distribution and out-of-distribution performance, which manifests as a secondary double descent phenomenon. We discover that attention-based models apply a transfer-operator forecasting strategy in-context. They (1) lift low-dimensional time series using delay embedding, to detect the system's higher-dimensional dynamical manifold, and (2) identify and forecast long-lived invariant sets that characterize the global flow on this manifold. Our results clarify the mechanism enabling large pretrained models to forecast unseen physical systems at test without retraining, and they illustrate the unique ability of attention-based models to leverage global attractor information in service of short-term forecasts."}

In this study, we propose a robust benchmarking approach to asses 10 foundational models on four histopathological datasets covering both morphological tissue-region and cellular/nuclear segmentation tasks. Our method leverages attention maps of foundation models as pixel-wise features, which are then classified using a machine learning algorithm, XGBoost, enabling fast, interpretable, and model-agnostic evaluation without finetuning. We show that the vision language foundation model, CONCH performed the best across datasets when compared to vision-only foundation models, with PathDino as close second. Further analysis shows that models trained on distinct histopathology cohorts capture complementary morphological representations, and concatenating their features yields superior segmentation performance. Concatenating features from CONCH, PathDino and CellViT outperformed individual models across all the datasets by 7.95% (averaged across the datasets), suggesting that ensembles of foundation models can better generalize to diverse histopathological segmentation tasks."}

We introduce I-TAP (In-Context Latent Temporal-Abstraction Planner), an offline RL framework that unifies in-context adaptation with online planning in a learned discrete temporal-abstraction space. From offline trajectories, I-TAP learns an observation-conditioned residual-quantization VAE that compresses each observation-macro-action segment into a coarse-to-fine stack of discrete residual tokens, and a temporal Transformer that autoregressively predicts these token stacks from a short recent history. The resulting sequence model acts simultaneously as a context-conditioned prior over abstract actions and a latent dynamics model. At test time, I-TAP performs Monte Carlo Tree Search directly in token space, using short histories for implicit adaptation without gradient update, and decodes selected token stacks into executable actions. Across deterministic MuJoCo, stochastic MuJoCo with per-episode latent dynamics regimes, and high-dimensional Adroit manipulation, including partially observable variants, I-TAP consistently matches or outperforms strong model-free and model-based offline baselines, demonstrating efficient and robust in-context planning under stochastic dynamics and partial observability."}

However, a persistent and long-standing limitation is the decline in facial identity (ID) consistency during realistic portrait editing. Due to the human eye's high sensitivity to facial features, such inconsistency significantly hinders the practical deployment of these models. Current facial ID preservation methods struggle to achieve consistent restoration of both facial identity and edited element IP due to Cross-source Distribution Bias and Cross-source Feature Contamination. To address these issues, we propose EditedID, an Alignment-Disentanglement-Entanglement framework for robust identity-specific facial restoration. By systematically analyzing diffusion trajectories, sampler behaviors, and attention properties, we introduce three key components: 1) Adaptive mixing strategy that aligns cross-source latent representations throughout the diffusion process. 2) Hybrid solver that disentangles source-specific identity attributes and details. 3) Attentional gating mechanism that selectively entangles visual elements. Extensive experiments show that EditedID achieves state-of-the-art performance in preserving original facial ID and edited element IP consistency. As a training-free and plug-and-play solution, it establishes a new benchmark for practical and reliable single/multi-person facial identity restoration in open-world settings, paving the way for the deployment of multimodal editing large models in real-person editing scenarios.

As the generative insertion model, we use a variable length masked diffusion model, which generates by inserting and filling mask tokens. On graph traversal tasks for which a locally optimal insertion order is known, we explore the choices of parameterization empirically and demonstrate the trade-offs between flexibility, training stability and generation quality.

To obtain robust inputs for spectral extraction at scale, we construct a compact shared structure with anchor-based high-order consensus modeling and apply a lightweight refinement to suppress noisy or inconsistent relations.

We propose TAG (Thinking with Action Unit Grounding), a vision--language framework that explicitly constrains multimodal reasoning to be supported by facial Action Units (AUs). TAG requires intermediate reasoning steps to be grounded in AU-related facial regions, yielding predictions accompanied by verifiable visual evidence.

A central challenge in assessing this risk is distinguishing genuine memorization of training data from the generation of statistically common sequences. Existing approaches to measuring memorization often conflate these phenomena, labeling outputs as memorized even when they arise from generalization over common patterns. Counterfactual Memorization provides a principled solution by comparing models trained with and without a target sequence, but its reliance on retraining multiple baseline models makes it computationally expensive and impractical at scale.\n  This work introduces Prior-Aware Memorization, a theoretically grounded, lightweight and training-free criterion for identifying genuine memorization in LLMs. The key idea is to evaluate whether a candidate suffix is strongly associated with its specific training prefix or whether it appears with high probability across many unrelated prompts due to statistical commonality.\n  We evaluate this metric on text from the training corpora of two pre-trained models, LLaMA and OPT, using both long sequences (to simulate copyright risks) and named entities (to simulate PII leakage). Our results show that between 55% and 90% of sequences previously labeled as memorized are in fact statistically common. Similar findings hold for the SATML training data extraction challenge dataset, where roughly 40% of sequences exhibit common-pattern behavior despite appearing only once in the training data. These results demonstrate that low frequency alone is insufficient evidence of memorization and highlight the importance of accounting for model priors when assessing leakage."}

In this work, we present GeoLink-UV, a high-resolution nationwide UV mapping product that clearly delineates the locations and boundaries of UVs in 342 Chinese cities. The dataset is derived from multisource geospatial data, including optical remote sensing images and geo-vector data, and is generated through a foundation model-driven mapping framework designed to address the generalization issues and improve the product quality. A geographically stratified accuracy assessment based on independent samples from 28 cities confirms the reliability and scientific credibility of the nationwide dataset across heterogeneous urban contexts. Based on this nationwide product, we reveal substantial interregional disparities in UV prevalence and spatial configuration. On average, UV areas account for 8 % of built-up land, with marked clustering in central and south China. Building-level analysis further confirms a consistent low-rise, high-density development pattern of UVs nationwide, while highlighting regionally differentiated morphological characteristics.

PhysCond-WMA is optimized in two stages: (1) a quality-preserving guidance stage that constrains reverse-diffusion loss below a calibrated threshold, and (2) a momentum-guided denoising stage that accumulates target-aligned gradients along the denoising trajectory for stable, temporally coherent semantic shifts.

A decentralized Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) approach by Value Decomposition Network (VDN) manages cycle-based traffic signal control (TSC) at intersections, while an innovative Signal Phase and Timing (SPaT) prediction method integrates a Machine Learning-based Trajectory Planning Algorithm (MLTPA) to guide CAVs in executing Eco-Approach and Departure (EAD) maneuvers.

The existing GAD methods often focus on the learning paradigms of \"one-model-for-one-dataset\", requiring dataset-specific training for each dataset to achieve optimal performance. However, this paradigm suffers from significant limitations, such as high computational and data costs, limited generalization and transferability to new datasets, and challenges in privacy-sensitive scenarios where access to full datasets or sufficient labels is restricted. To address these limitations, we propose a novel generalist GAD paradigm that aims to develop a unified model capable of detecting anomalies on multiple unseen datasets without extensive retraining/fine-tuning or dataset-specific customization. To this end, we propose ARC, a few-shot generalist GAD method that leverages in-context learning and requires only a few labeled normal samples at inference time. Specifically, ARC consists of three core modules: a feature Alignment module to unify and align features across datasets, a Residual GNN encoder to capture dataset-agnostic anomaly representations, and a cross-attentive in-Context learning module to score anomalies using few-shot normal context. Building on ARC, we further introduce ARC_zero for the zero-shot generalist GAD setting, which selects representative pseudo-normal nodes via a pseudo-context mechanism and thus enables fully label-free inference on unseen datasets. Extensive experiments on 17 real-world graph datasets demonstrate that both ARC and ARC_zero effectively detect anomalies, exhibit strong generalization ability, and perform efficiently under few-shot and zero-shot settings."}

It consists of two key components: (1) The dynamic spatial-temporal state propagation autoregressive model (STAR) is proposed, which achieves spatial-temporal consistent generation. Unlike standard autoregressive models, STAR divides prediction tokens into groups based on timesteps. It models long-term dependencies by propagating spatial-temporal states from previous groups and utilizes these dependencies to guide generation at the next timestep. To this end, a spatial-temporal container is proposed, which dynamically updating the effective spatial-temporal state features from all historical groups, then updated features serve as conditional features to guide the prediction of the next token group. (2) The 4D VQ-VAE is proposed, which implicitly encodes the 4D structure into discrete space and decodes the discrete tokens predicted by STAR into temporally coherent dynamic 3D Gaussians.

However, in the short train long test setting, autoregressive rollouts can become unstable. This typically happens for two reasons: one step errors accumulate over time, and high frequency components feed back and grow.\n  We introduce the Spectral Generator Neural Operator (SGNO), a residual time stepper that targets both effects. For the linear part, SGNO uses an exponential time differencing update in Fourier space with a learned diagonal generator. We constrain the real part of this generator to be nonpositive, so iterating the step does not amplify the linear dynamics. For nonlinear dynamics, SGNO adds a gated forcing term with channel mixing within each Fourier mode, which keeps the nonlinear update controlled. To further limit high frequency feedback, SGNO applies spectral truncation and an optional smooth mask on the forcing pathway.\n  We derive a one step amplification bound and a finite horizon rollout error bound. The bound separates generator approximation error from nonlinear mismatch and gives sufficient conditions under which the latent $L^2$ norm does not grow across rollout steps. On APEBench spanning 1D, 2D, and 3D PDE families, SGNO achieves lower long horizon error and longer stable rollout lengths than strong neural operator baselines.

In this work, we propose IDPERTURB, a simple yet effective geometric-driven sampling strategy to enhance diversity in synthetic face generation. IDPERTURB perturbs identity embeddings within a constrained angular region of the unit hyper-sphere, producing a diverse set of embeddings without modifying the underlying generative model. Each perturbed embedding serves as a conditioning vector for a pre-trained diffusion model, enabling the synthesis of visually varied yet identity-coherent face images suitable for training generalizable FR systems.

Such sparse networks can lower the demand for computational resources at inference, and during training. The existence of the LTH and corresponding sparse subnetworks in BNNs could motivate the development of sparse training algorithms and provide valuable insights into the underlying training process. Towards this end, we translate the LTH experiments to a Bayesian setting using common computer vision models. We investigate the defining characteristics of Bayesian lottery tickets, and extend our study towards a transplantation method connecting BNNs with deterministic Lottery Tickets. We generally find that the LTH holds in BNNs, and winning tickets of matching and surpassing accuracy are present independent of model size, with degradation at very high sparsities.

A few deep learning methods have used additional preprocessing stages or network modules to address the problem, whereas several other methods have utilized pre-trained backbone CNNs, most of which are computationally intensive. Therefore, to address the challenge, we propose a lightweight autoencoder using separable convolutional layers in its encoder decoder blocks. A sigmoid gating is applied for refining the prowess of the encoders feature discriminability, which is improved further by the decoder. Finally, the feature maps of the encoder decoder are combined for rich feature representation before classification.

In this paper, we introduce a novel factorization of the GFT into operators acting on subgraphs, which are then combined via a sequence of Cauchy matrices. We use this factorization to propose a new class of spectral GNNs, which we term L2G-Net (Local-to-Global Net). Unlike existing spectral methods, which are either fully global (when they use the GFT) or local (when they use polynomial filters), L2G-Net operates by processing the spectral representations of subgraphs and then combining them via structured matrices. Our algorithm avoids full eigendecompositions, exploiting graph topology to construct the factorization with quadratic complexity in the number of nodes, scaled by the subgraph interface size. Experiments on benchmarks stressing non-local dependencies show that L2G-Net outperforms existing spectral techniques and is competitive with the state-of-the-art with orders of magnitude fewer learnable parameters."}

Grounded in the principle that all manipulations deviate from the natural image manifold, IFA-Net leverages a frozen Masked Autoencoder (MAE) pretrained on real images as a universal realness prior. Our framework operates through a two-stage closed-loop process: an initial Dual-Stream Segmentation Network (DSSN) fuses the original image with MAE reconstruction residuals for coarse localization, followed by a Task-Adaptive Prior Injection (TAPI) module that converts this coarse prediction into guiding prompts to steer the MAE decoder and amplify reconstruction failures in suspicious regions for precise refinement. Extensive experiments on four diffusion-based inpainting benchmarks show that IFA-Net achieves an average improvement of 6.5% in IoU and 8.1% in F1-score over the second-best method, while demonstrating strong generalization to traditional manipulation types."}

(2) We introduce a block-$\\infty$/RMS geometry aligned with tokenwise computation, yielding Lipschitz bounds independent of sequence length. Using this framework, we prove that pre-LN preserves identity gradient paths while post-LN compounds LayerNorm Jacobians exponentially with depth, and we show that DeepNorm's $N^{-1/4}$ emerges from the quartic structure of attention's four projection matrices. We validate our theory on 774M-parameter models and find that, contrary to the intuition that attention sharpens during training to reduce sensitivity, $θ(p) \\approx 1$ persists throughout. Transformer stability arises entirely from architectural gradient flow, not from attention dynamics. This finding changes how we reason about training: the architecture itself must handle sensitivity, not learned attention patterns."}

In this paper, we propose a framework for generating copyright triggers for MLLMs, enabling model publishers to embed verifiable ownership information into the model. The goal is to construct trigger images that elicit ownership-related textual responses exclusively in fine-tuned derivatives of the original model, while remaining inert in other non-derivative models. Our method constructs a tracking trigger image by treating the image as a learnable tensor, performing adversarial optimization with dual-injection of ownership-relevant semantic information. The first injection is achieved by enforcing textual consistency between the output of an auxiliary MLLM and a predefined ownership-relevant target text; the consistency loss is backpropagated to inject this ownership-related information into the image. The second injection is performed at the semantic-level by minimizing the distance between the CLIP features of the image and those of the target text. Furthermore, we introduce an additional adversarial training stage involving the auxiliary model derived from the original model itself. This auxiliary model is specifically trained to resist generating ownership-relevant target text, thereby enhancing robustness in heavily fine-tuned derivative models. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our dual-injection approach in tracking model lineage under various fine-tuning and domain-shift scenarios."}

A key challenge in RL is measuring task complexity, which is essential for creating meaningful benchmarks and designing effective curricula. While there are numerous well-established metrics for assessing task complexity in tabular settings, relatively few exist in non-tabular domains. These include (i) Statistical analysis of the performance of random policies via Random Weight Guessing (RWG), and (ii) information-theoretic metrics Policy Information Capacity (PIC) and Policy-Optimal Information Capacity (POIC), which are reliant on RWG. In this paper, we evaluate these methods using progressively difficult robotic manipulation setups, with known relative complexity, with both dense and sparse reward formulations. Our empirical results reveal that measuring complexity is still nuanced. Specifically, under the same reward formulation, PIC suggests that a two-link robotic arm setup is easier than a single-link setup - which contradicts the robotic control and empirical RL perspective whereby the two-link setup is inherently more complex. Likewise, for the same setup, POIC estimates that tasks with sparse rewards are easier than those with dense rewards. Thus, we show that both PIC and POIC contradict typical understanding and empirical results from RL. These findings highlight the need to move beyond RWG-based metrics towards better metrics that can more reliably capture task complexity in non-tabular RL with our task framework as a starting point."}

Furthermore, we introduce a data-free calibration strategy that synthesizes diverse, label-free samples using Stable Diffusion Turbo guided by learned multi-mode prompts. By encouraging diversity in both the learned prompt embeddings and the generated image features, our data-free approach achieves performance on par with real-data ImageNet calibration and surpasses simple text-prompt baselines such as \"a <adjective> photo of <adjective> <cls>\"."}

Vision-Language Models (VLMs) address the cold-start problem via zero-shot predictions, yet their temperature-scaled softmax outputs treat text-image similarities as deterministic scores while ignoring inherent uncertainty, leading to overconfidence. This overconfidence misleads sample selection, wasting annotation budgets on uninformative cases. To overcome these limitations, the Similarity-as-Evidence (SaE) framework calibrates text-image similarities by introducing a Similarity Evidence Head (SEH), which reinterprets the similarity vector as evidence and parameterizes a Dirichlet distribution over labels. In contrast to a standard softmax that enforces confident predictions even under weak signals, the Dirichlet formulation explicitly quantifies lack of evidence (vacuity) and conflicting evidence (dissonance), thereby mitigating overconfidence caused by rigid softmax normalization. Building on this, SaE employs a dual-factor acquisition strategy: high-vacuity samples (e.g., rare diseases) are prioritized in early rounds to ensure coverage, while high-dissonance samples (e.g., ambiguous diagnoses) are prioritized later to refine boundaries, providing clinically interpretable selection rationales. Experiments on ten public medical imaging datasets with a 20% label budget show that SaE attains state-of-the-art macro-averaged accuracy of 82.57%. On the representative BTMRI dataset, SaE also achieves superior calibration, with a negative log-likelihood (NLL) of 0.425."}

We show that geometric median aggregation achieves $(α,β)$-boostability for a broad class of divergences, with tradeoffs that depend on the underlying geometry.

To address this issue, we enhance this task by shaping dense and accurate 2D predictions. Specifically, we develop a multi-modal segmentation model, MM2D3D. By leveraging camera images as auxiliary data, we introduce cross-modal guided filtering to overcome label map sparsity by constraining intermediate 2D semantic predictions with dense semantic relations derived from the camera images; and we introduce dynamic cross pseudo supervision to overcome LiDAR map sparsity by encouraging the 2D predictions to emulate the dense distribution of the semantic predictions from the camera images.

The focus of research in both KG embedding and GNNs has been mostly oriented towards simple graphs with binary relations. However, real-world knowledge bases have a significant share of complex and n-ary facts that cannot be represented by binary edges. More specifically, real-world knowledge bases are often a mix of two types of n-ary facts - (i) that require hyperedges and (ii) that require hyper-relational edges. Though there are research efforts catering to these n-ary fact types, they are pursued independently for each type. We propose $H$yper$E$dge $H$yper-$R$elational edge $GNN$(HEHRGNN), a unified embedding model for n-ary relational KGs with both hyperedges and hyper-relational edges.

We address these limitations by representing motion with continuous differentiable B-spline curves, enabling more effective motion generation without modifying the capabilities of the underlying generative model. Specifically, our closed-form, Laplacian-regularized B-spline solver efficiently compresses variable-length motion sequences into compact representations with a fixed number of control points. Further, we introduce a normal-fusion strategy for input shape adherence along with correspondence-aware and local-rigidity losses for motion-restoration quality.

The resulting model, PCA-VAE, learns an orthogonal, variance-ordered latent basis without codebooks, commitment losses, or lookup noise. Despite its simplicity, PCA-VAE exceeds VQ-GAN and SimVQ in reconstruction quality on CelebAHQ while using 10-100x fewer latent bits.

We propose the Structure-Level Disentangled Diffusion Model (SLD-Font), which receives content and style information from two separate channels. SimSun-style images are used as content templates and concatenated with noisy latent features as the input. Style features extracted by a CLIP model from target-style images are integrated via cross-attention. Additionally, we train a Background Noise Removal module in the pixel space to remove background noise in complex stroke regions. Based on theoretical validation of disentanglement effectiveness, we introduce a parameter-efficient fine-tuning strategy that updates only the style-related modules. This allows the model to better adapt to new styles while avoiding overfitting to the reference images' content. We further introduce the Grey and OCR metrics to evaluate the content quality of generated characters. Experimental results show that SLD-Font achieves significantly higher style fidelity while maintaining comparable content accuracy to existing state-of-the-art methods."}

DeepInterestGR introduces three key innovations: (1) Multi-LLM Interest Mining (MLIM): We leverage multiple frontier LLMs along with their multi-modal variants to extract deep textual and visual interest representations through Chain-of-Thought prompting.

In this paper, we show that instability is not inherent to acceleration. We prove that gradient descent with a simple, non-adaptive increasing step-size schedule achieves exponential convergence for separable logistic regression under a margin condition, while remaining entirely within a stable optimization regime. The resulting method is anytime and does not require prior knowledge of the optimization horizon or target accuracy. We also establish exponential convergence of stochastic gradient descent using a lightweight adaptive step-size rule that avoids line search and specialized procedures, improving upon existing polynomial-rate guarantees.

Key findings include an observed 91% Mandatory compliance rate and 94% Prohibitions compliance rate across 621 structured prompts, a comparative batch consistency test demonstrating substantially higher inter-generation coherence for structured prompts, independent practitioner validation (n=40), and a dedicated Information Design validation demonstrating >95% first-generation compliance for spatial and typographical control across approximately 300 publicly verifiable infographics.

However, many of these applications are inherently sequential, involving continuous data streams such as real-time sensor readings or database updates. In such settings, models should support cheap, incremental updates rather than recomputing internal representations from scratch for every new observation -- a capability existing TNP variants lack. Drawing inspiration from Large Language Models, we introduce the Incremental TNP (incTNP). By leveraging causal masking, Key-Value (KV) caching, and a data-efficient autoregressive training strategy, incTNP matches the predictive performance of standard TNPs while reducing the computational cost of updates from quadratic to linear time complexity. We empirically evaluate our model on a range of synthetic and real-world tasks, including tabular regression and temperature prediction. Our results show that, surprisingly, incTNP delivers performance comparable to -- or better than -- non-causal TNPs while unlocking orders-of-magnitude speedups for sequential inference. Finally, we assess the consistency of the model's updates -- by adapting a metric of ``implicit Bayesianness\", we show that incTNP retains a prediction rule as implicitly Bayesian as standard non-causal TNPs, demonstrating that incTNP achieves the computational benefits of causal masking without sacrificing the consistency required for streaming inference."}

To address these issues, we introduce DACo, a planning-grounding decoupled architecture that disentangles global deliberation from local grounding.

Although YOLOv8 provides reliable localization, the RGB-only model shows limited safety performance, achieving high precision (0.99) but low recall (0.49) due to insufficient ballast, as it tends to over-predict the sufficient class. To improve reliability, we incorporate depth-based geometric analysis enabled by a sleeper-aligned depth-correction pipeline that compensates for RealSense spatial distortion using polynomial modeling, RANSAC, and temporal smoothing. SAM2 segmentation further refines region-of-interest masks, enabling accurate extraction of sleeper and ballast profiles for geometric classification.\n  Experiments on field-collected top-down RGB-D data show that depth-enhanced configurations substantially improve the detection of insufficient ballast. Depending on bounding-box sampling (AABB or RBB) and geometric criteria, recall increases from 0.49 to as high as 0.80, and F1-score improves from 0.66 to over 0.80.

By modeling iterative feedback as a Markov Chain, we show that two conditions are needed for this resonance to occur: ergodicity of the feedback process and directional contraction of the latent representation.

This limitation arises because such abnormal patterns can closely resemble the regular patterns when presented in the same time/frequency domain. To address this issue, we introduce TimeRadar, an innovative TSFM built in a fractional time-frequency domain to support generalist TSAD across diverse unseen datasets. Our key insight is that rotating a time series into a data-dependent fractional time-frequency representation can adaptively differentiate the normal and abnormal signals across different datasets. To this end, a novel component, namely Fractionally modulated Time-Frequency Reconstruction (FTFRecon), is proposed in TimeRadar to leverage a learnable fractional order to rotate the time series to the most pronounced angle between a continuous time and frequency domain for accurate data reconstruction. This provides adaptive data reconstruction in an optimal time-frequency domain for each data input, enabling effective differentiation of the unbounded abnormal patterns from the regular ones across datasets, including unseen datasets.

This bidirectional constraint provides a strong self-supervisory signal without requiring ground-truth annotations and enables test-time training (TTT) at inference. Experiments on the Ego-Exo4D and HANDAL-X benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of our optimization objective and TTT strategy, achieving state-of-the-art performance.

While these operators are traditionally analyzed through spectral decompositions, their connection to reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces (RKHS) has not been systematically explored within the algebraic signal processing framework. In this paper, we develop a comprehensive theory showing that the range of integral operators naturally induces RKHS convolutional signal models whose reproducing kernels are determined by a box product of the operator symbols. We characterize the algebraic and spectral properties of these induced RKHS and show that polynomial filtering with integral operators corresponds to iterated box products, giving rise to a unital kernel algebra. This perspective yields pointwise RKHS representations of filters via the reproducing property, providing an alternative to operator-based implementations. Our results establish precise connections between eigendecompositions and RKHS representations in graphon signal processing, extend naturally to directed graphons, and enable novel spatial--spectral localization results. Furthermore, we show that when the spectral domain is a subset of the original domain of the signals, optimal filters for regularized learning problems admit finite-dimensional RKHS representations, providing a principled foundation for learnable filters in integral-operator-based neural architectures."}

While sign-based optimizers such as I-FGSM and MI-FGSM have become the de facto standard for the induced optimization problems, there still exist several unsolved problems in theoretical grounding and practical reliability especially in non-convergence and instability, which inevitably influences their transferability. Contrary to the expectation, we observe that the attack success rate may degrade sharply when more number of iterations are conducted. In this paper, we address these issues from an optimization perspective. By reformulating the sign-based optimizer as a specific coordinate-wise gradient descent, we argue that one cause for non-convergence and instability is their non-decaying step-size scheduling. Based upon this viewpoint, we propose a series of new attack algorithms that enforce Monotonically Decreasing Coordinate-wise Step-sizes (MDCS) within sign-based optimizers. Typically, we further provide theoretical guarantees proving that MDCS-MI attains an optimal convergence rate of $O(1/\\sqrt{T})$, where $T$ is the number of iterations. Extensive experiments on image classification and cross-modal retrieval tasks demonstrate that our approach not only significantly improves transferability but also enhances attack stability compared to state-of-the-art sign-based methods."}

To isolate motion-relevant cues, MoBind aligns IMU signals with skeletal motion sequences rather than raw pixels. We further decompose full-body motion into local body-part trajectories, pairing each with its corresponding IMU to enable semantically grounded multi-sensor alignment.

This conventional approach of iterating over the entire static dataset each epoch wastes considerable resources on easy-to-learn or repetitive samples. In this paper, we explore a novel training-efficiency techniques, namely learning from complexity with dynamic sample pruning, ST-Prune, for spatio-temporal forecasting. Through dynamic sample pruning, we aim to intelligently identify the most informative samples based on the model's real-time learning state, thereby accelerating convergence and improving training efficiency.

Starting from the classical equivalence between ridge-regularized RF training and Bayesian inference with Gaussian priors and likelihoods, we replace the single prior and likelihood with $ε$- and $η$-contaminated credal sets, respectively, and perform inference using pessimistic generalized Bayesian updating. We derive explicit and tractable bounds for the resulting lower and upper posterior predictive densities. These bounds show that, when contamination is moderate, prior and likelihood ambiguity effectively acts as a direct contamination of the posterior predictive distribution, yielding uncertainty envelopes around the classical Gaussian predictive. We introduce an Imprecise Highest Density Region (IHDR) for robust predictive uncertainty quantification and show that it admits an efficient outer approximation via an adjusted Gaussian credible interval. We further obtain predictive variance bounds (under a mild truncation approximation for the upper bound) and prove that they preserve the leading-order proportional-growth asymptotics known for RF models. Together, these results establish a robustness theory for Bayesian random features: predictive uncertainty remains computationally tractable, inherits the classical double-descent phase structure, and is improved by explicit worst-case guarantees under bounded prior and likelihood misspecification."}

These methods struggle to disentangle and attribute each concept individually. In this work, we introduce TokenTrace, a novel proactive watermarking framework for robust, multi-concept attribution. Our method embeds secret signatures into the semantic domain by simultaneously perturbing the text prompt embedding and the initial latent noise that guide the diffusion model's generation process.

Existing VO methods are trained on fixed observation frequency (e.g., 10Hz or 12Hz), completely overlooking temporal dynamics information. Many prior methods also require calibrated cameras with known intrinsic parameters. Consequently, their performance degrades when (1) deployed under unseen observation frequencies or (2) applied to uncalibrated cameras.

We model these dynamics using simplified differential equations that characterize the trajectory and prove stage-wise convergence results. Our analysis reveals that transformers ascend a complexity ladder by passing through simpler, misspecified hypothesis classes before reaching the full model class. We further show that early stopping acts as an implicit regularizer, biasing the model toward these simpler classes.

Existing data generation approaches rely on open-loop pipelines and fixed modifications that do not adapt to the model's capabilities. Furthermore, they typically operate directly on word problems, limiting control over problem structure. To address this, we perform modifications in a symbolic problem space, representing each problem as a set of symbolic variables and constraints (e.g., via algebraic frameworks such as SymPy or SMT formulations). This representation enables precise control over problem structure, automatic generation of ground-truth solutions, and decouples mathematical reasoning from linguistic realization. We also show that this results in more diverse generations. To adapt the problem difficulty to the model, we introduce a closed-loop framework that learns modification strategies through prompt optimization in symbolic space. Experimental results demonstrate that both adaptive problem generation and symbolic representation modifications contribute to improving the model's math solving ability."}

However, their application to text-guided image editing remains severely hampered, as forcing existing training-free editors into a single inference step fails. This failure manifests as severe object distortion and a critical loss of consistency in non-edited regions, resulting from the high-energy, erratic trajectories produced by naive vector arithmetic on the models' structured fields. To address this problem, we introduce ChordEdit, a model agnostic, training-free, and inversion-free method that facilitates high-fidelity one-step editing. We recast editing as a transport problem between the source and target distributions defined by the source and target text prompts. Leveraging dynamic optimal transport theory, we derive a principled, low-energy control strategy. This strategy yields a smoothed, variance-reduced editing field that is inherently stable, facilitating the field to be traversed in a single, large integration step. A theoretically grounded and experimentally validated approach allows ChordEdit to deliver fast, lightweight and precise edits, finally achieving true real-time editing on these challenging models."}

We evaluate HybridFL in a financial crime detection context, where a transaction party holds transaction-level attributes and multiple banks maintain private account-level features. By integrating horizontal aggregation and vertical feature fusion, the proposed architecture enables joint learning while strictly preserving data locality.

However, due to its highly cursive forms and extensive glyph variations, most modern Japanese readers cannot directly interpret Kuzushiji characters. Therefore, recent research has focused on developing automated Kuzushiji character recognition methods, which have achieved satisfactory performance on relatively clean Kuzushiji document images. However, existing methods struggle to maintain recognition accuracy under seal interference (e.g., when seals overlap characters), despite the frequent occurrence of seals in pre-modern Japanese documents. To address this challenge, we propose a three-stage restoration-guided Kuzushiji character recognition (RG-KCR) framework specifically designed to mitigate seal interference. We construct datasets for evaluating Kuzushiji character detection (Stage 1) and classification (Stage 3). Experimental results show that the YOLOv12-medium model achieves a precision of 98.0% and a recall of 93.3% on the constructed test set. We quantitatively evaluate the restoration performance of Stage 2 using PSNR and SSIM.

To overcome these limitations, we present Ani3DHuman, a framework that marries kinematics-based animation with video diffusion priors. We first introduce a layered motion representation that disentangles rigid motion from residual non-rigid motion. Rigid motion is generated by a kinematic method, which then produces a coarse rendering to guide the video diffusion model in generating video sequences that restore the residual non-rigid motion. However, this restoration task, based on diffusion sampling, is highly challenging, as the initial renderings are out-of-distribution, causing standard deterministic ODE samplers to fail. Therefore, we propose a novel self-guided stochastic sampling method, which effectively addresses the out-of-distribution problem by combining stochastic sampling (for photorealistic quality) with self-guidance (for identity fidelity). These restored videos provide high-quality supervision, enabling the optimization of the residual non-rigid motion field.

This framework, designed for two-layer neural networks, enables direct inspection of the knowledge encoded in the model weights. We reproduce baseline unlearning methods within the combinatorial interpretability setting and examine their behavior along two dimensions: (i) whether they truly remove knowledge of a target concept (the concept we wish to remove) or merely inhibit its expression while retaining the underlying information, and (ii) how easily the supposedly erased knowledge can be recovered through various fine-tuning operations. Our results shed light within a fully interpretable setting on how knowledge can persist despite unlearning and when it might resurface."}

We argue that both generative and embedding tasks fundamentally rely on shared cognitive mechanisms, specifically cross-modal representation alignment and contextual comprehension. To this end, we propose CREM (Compression-driven Representation Enhanced Model), with a unified framework that enhances multimodal representations for retrieval while preserving generative ability. Specifically, we introduce a compression-based prompt design with learnable chorus tokens to aggregate multimodal semantics and a compression-driven training strategy that integrates contrastive and generative objectives through compression-aware attention.

RPT-1 is a compact 64.6 MB model pretrained on 1.34 TB of structured data across 3.1 million tables. We benchmark it against tuned gradient-boosted decision trees (XGBoost, LightGBM, CatBoost) on three SAP business scenarios: demand forecasting across SD/MM/PP modules, predictive data integrity in BC/MM/QM, and financial risk classification in FI/CO/AR. Across five-fold cross-validation on datasets ranging from 2,500 to 3,200 rows, RPT-1 reaches 91-96% of tuned GBDT accuracy without any training examples. The classification gap is modest at 3.6-4.1 percentage points on AUC-ROC, though regression tasks show wider gaps of 8.9-11.1 percentage points on R-squared. An interesting finding is a crossover at roughly 75-100 context rows where RPT-1 actually outperforms XGBoost under limited data.

The key insight is to lift \"coarse\" semantic cues into \"fine\" correspondence, which is achieved through two stages. In the \"coarse\" stage, we perform class-agnostic 3D segmentation to obtain non-overlapping semantic parts and prompt multimodal large language models (MLLMs) to identify part names. Then, we employ pretrained vision language models (VLMs) to extract text embeddings, enabling the construction of matched semantic parts. In the \"fine\" stage, we leverage these coarse correspondences to guide the learning of dense correspondences through a dedicated rank-based contrastive scheme. Thanks to class-agnostic segmentation, language guiding, and rank-based contrastive learning, our method is versatile for universal object categories and requires no predefined part proposals, enabling universal matching for inter-class and non-isometric shapes.

In this study, we address this underexplored challenge by introducing Symbolic Projective Layout (SymPL), a framework that reformulates allocentric reasoning into symbolic-layout forms that VLMs inherently handle well. By leveraging four key factors-projection, abstraction, bipartition, and localization-SymPL converts allocentric questions into structured symbolic-layout representations. Extensive experiments demonstrate that this reformulation substantially improves performance in both allocentric and egocentric tasks, enhances robustness under visual illusions and multi-view scenarios, and that each component contributes critically to these gains. These results show that SymPL provides an effective and principled approach for addressing complex perspective-aware spatial reasoning."}

We propose Directed Graph Policy Optimization (DGPO), which extends reinforcement learning fine-tuning of discrete graph diffusion models to DAGs via topological node ordering and positional encoding.

The central finding is that the model learns transferable structural priors: pretrained on only 7% of the search space, it generates near-oracle architectures after fine-tuning, within 0.32 percentage points of the full-data model and extrapolating 7.3 percentage points beyond its training ceiling. Bidirectional control experiments confirm genuine reward-driven steering, with inverse optimization reaching near random-chance accuracy (9.5%).

The dataset contains over 12 million images covering more than 8,300 common street tree species, collected from urban streetscapes across 133 countries spanning five continents, and supplemented with expert-verified observational data.

While spectral bias is often treated as an intrinsic representational limitation of neural architectures, its interaction with optimization dynamics and physics-based loss formulations remains poorly understood. In this work, we provide a systematic investigation of spectral bias in physics-informed and operator learning frameworks, with emphasis on the coupled roles of network architecture, activation functions, loss design, and optimization strategy. We quantify spectral bias through frequency-resolved error metrics, Barron-norm diagnostics, and higher-order statistical moments, enabling a unified analysis across elliptic, hyperbolic, and dispersive PDEs. Through diverse benchmark problems, including the Korteweg-de Vries, wave and steady-state diffusion-reaction equations, turbulent flow reconstruction, and earthquake dynamics, we demonstrate that spectral bias is not simply representational but fundamentally dynamical. In particular, second-order optimization methods substantially alter the spectral learning order, enabling earlier and more accurate recovery of high-frequency modes for all PDE types.

Specifically, we leverage the `one-to-many mapping' strategy in rectified flow that allows each data point of the source modality to observe the overall target distribution. This also alleviates the issue of insufficient paired data within each sample, enabling a more robust distribution transformation. Moreover, to achieve more accurate distribution mapping and address the ambiguous flow directions in one-to-many mapping, we design `adaptive relaxed alignment', enforcing stricter alignment for modality pairs belonging to the same sample, while applying relaxed mapping for pairs not belonging to the same sample or category. Additionally, to prevent information loss during distribution mapping, we introduce `cyclic rectified flow' to ensure the transferred features can be translated back to the original features, allowing multimodal representations to learn sufficient modality-specific information. After distribution alignment, our approach achieves very competitive results on multiple tasks of multimodal affective computing even with a simple fusion method, and visualizations verify that it can effectively reduce the modality gap."}

Two prominent directions have emerged: (i) a shift toward sequence-level importance sampling weights that better align with the sequence-level rewards used in many tasks, and (ii) alternatives to PPO-style clipping that aim to avoid the associated loss of training signal and entropy collapse. Recent work, such as Soft Adaptive Policy Optimization (SAPO), reformulates the Scopic objective within the GRPO framework and achieves both sequence coherence and token adaptivity. Geometric-Mean Policy Optimization (GMPO) leverages token-wise ratio clipping within sequence importance sampling weights. Building on these ideas, this work proposes a new objective that promotes effective policy exploration while maintaining training stability. Specifically, we introduce Soft Sequence Policy Optimization, an off-policy reinforcement learning objective that incorporates soft gating functions over token-level probability ratios within sequence-level importance weights."}

A dataset of 2,540 routinely acquired microscopy images was manually annotated using a multi-class strategy to explicitly distinguish fungal elements from confounding artefacts. The model was trained with morphology-preserving augmentations to maintain the structural integrity of thin hyphae. Evaluation on an independent test set demonstrated robust object-level performance, with a recall of 0.9737, precision of 0.8043, and an AP@0.50 of 93.56%.

However, practical deployment remains limited due to the prohibitive memory and runtime cost of operating on raw gate-level netlists. Graph coarsening is commonly used to improve scalability, yet its impact on CTS-critical learning objectives is not well characterized. This paper introduces CTS-Bench, a benchmark suite for systematically evaluating the trade-offs between graph coarsening, prediction accuracy, and computational efficiency in GNN-based CTS analysis. CTS-Bench consists of 4,860 converged physical design solutions spanning five architectures and provides paired raw gate-level and clustered graph representations derived from post-placement designs. Using clock skew prediction as a representative CTS task, we demonstrate a clear accuracy-efficiency trade-off. While graph coarsening reduces GPU memory usage by up to 17.2x and accelerates training by up to 3x, it also removes structural information essential for modeling clock distribution, frequently resulting in negative $R^2$ scores under zero-shot evaluation. Our findings indicate that generic graph clustering techniques can fundamentally compromise CTS learning objectives, even when global physical metrics remain unchanged. CTS-Bench enables principled evaluation of CTS-aware graph coarsening strategies, supports benchmarking of GNN architectures and accelerators under realistic physical design constraints, and provides a foundation for developing learning-assisted CTS analysis and optimization techniques."}

We extend the soft-matching distance to a partial optimal transport setting that allows some neurons to remain unmatched, yielding rotation-sensitive but robust correspondences. This partial soft-matching distance provides theoretical advantages -- relaxing strict mass conservation while maintaining interpretable transport costs -- and practical benefits through efficient neuron ranking in terms of cross-network alignment without costly iterative recomputation. In simulations, it preserves correct matches under outliers and reliably selects the correct model in noise-corrupted identification tasks. On fMRI data, it automatically excludes low-reliability voxels and produces voxel rankings by alignment quality that closely match computationally expensive brute-force approaches. It achieves higher alignment precision across homologous brain areas than standard soft-matching, which is forced to match all units regardless of quality. In deep networks, highly matched units exhibit similar maximally exciting images, while unmatched units show divergent patterns. This ability to partition by match quality enables focused analyses, e.g., testing whether networks have privileged axes even within their most aligned subpopulations. Overall, partial soft-matching provides a principled and practical method for representational comparison under partial correspondence."}

To bridge the gap, this paper presents JavisDiT++, a concise yet powerful framework for unified modeling and optimization of JAVG. First, we introduce a modality-specific mixture-of-experts (MS-MoE) design that enables cross-modal interaction efficacy while enhancing single-modal generation quality. Then, we propose a temporal-aligned RoPE (TA-RoPE) strategy to achieve explicit, frame-level synchronization between audio and video tokens.

We formalize Universal Message Passing Mixture (UMPM), a shared operator family that expresses heterogeneous GNN layers in a common functional language.

Existing continual AQA methods overlook this issue and assume that all modalities remain complete and stable throughout training, which restricts their practicality. To address this challenge, we introduce Bridged Modality Adaptation (BriMA), an innovative approach to multi-modal continual AQA under modality-missing conditions. BriMA consists of a memory-guided bridging imputation module that reconstructs missing modalities using both task-agnostic and task-specific representations, and a modality-aware replay mechanism that prioritizes informative samples based on modality distortion and distribution drift. Experiments on three representative multi-modal AQA datasets (RG, Fis-V, and FS1000) show that BriMA consistently improves performance under different modality-missing conditions, achieving 6--8\\% higher correlation and 12--15\\% lower error on average.

However, perhaps not every component of a system needs to generalize. Training models for generalization typically produces entangled representations at the boundaries of entities or classes, which can lead to destructive interference when rapid, high-magnitude updates are required for continual or few-shot learning. Techniques for fast learning with non-interfering representations exist, but they generally fail to generalize. Here, we describe a Complementary Learning System (CLS) in which the fast learner entirely foregoes generalization in exchange for continual zero-shot and few-shot learning. Unlike most CLS approaches, which use episodic memory primarily for replay and consolidation, our fast, disentangled learner operates as a parallel reasoning system. The fast learner can overcome observation variability and uncertainty by leveraging a conventional slow, statistical learner within an active perception system: A contextual bias provided by the fast learner induces the slow learner to encode novel stimuli in familiar, generalized terms, enabling zero-shot and few-shot learning. This architecture demonstrates that fast, context-driven reasoning can coexist with slow, structured generalization, providing a pathway for robust continual learning."}

To address this, we introduce a dual-memory augmented HMR critique agent with self-reflection to produce context-aware quality scores for predicted meshes. These scores distill fine-grained cues about 3D human motion structure, physical feasibility, and alignment with the input image. We use these scores to build a group-wise HMR preference dataset. Leveraging this dataset, we propose a group preference alignment framework for finetuning diffusion-based HMR models. This process injects the rich preference signals into the model, guiding it to generate more physically plausible and image-consistent human meshes.

In this work, we embrace off-policyness and propose a novel off-policy RL algorithm that does not require these modifications: Optimal Advantage-based Policy Optimization with Lagged Inference policy (OAPL). We show that OAPL outperforms GRPO with importance sampling on competition math benchmarks, and can match the performance of a publicly available coding model, DeepCoder, on LiveCodeBench, while using 3x fewer generations during training. We further empirically demonstrate that models trained via OAPL have improved test time scaling under the Pass@k metric. OAPL allows for efficient, effective post-training even with lags of more than 400 gradient steps between the training and inference policies, 100x more off-policy than prior approaches."}

Additionally, the extensive parameters of MLLMs necessitate substantial computational resources and large-scale data for effective training. Conversely, text spotting specialists achieve state-of-the-art coordinate predictions but lack semantic reasoning capabilities. This dichotomy motivates our key research question: Can we synergize the efficiency of specialists with the contextual power of LLMs to create a positionally-accurate MLLM?

While current methods adapt CLIP by projecting 3D point clouds into 2D representations, they face challenges. The projection inherently loses some geometric details, and the reliance on a single 2D modality provides an incomplete visual understanding, limiting their ability to detect diverse anomaly types. To address these limitations, we propose the Geometry-Aware Prompt and Synergistic View Representation Learning (GS-CLIP) framework, which enables the model to identify geometric anomalies through a two-stage learning process. In stage 1, we dynamically generate text prompts embedded with 3D geometric priors. These prompts contain global shape context and local defect information distilled by our Geometric Defect Distillation Module (GDDM). In stage 2, we introduce Synergistic View Representation Learning architecture that processes rendered and depth images in parallel. A Synergistic Refinement Module (SRM) subsequently fuses the features of both streams, capitalizing on their complementary strengths. Comprehensive experimental results on four large-scale public datasets show that GS-CLIP achieves superior performance in detection.

While data assimilation can mitigate these issues, classical variational smoothers require computationally expensive tangent-linear and adjoint models. Conversely, recent efficient latent filtering methods often enforce weak trajectory-level constraints and assume fixed observation grids. To bridge this gap, we propose Latent Ensemble Variational Data Assimilation (LEVDA), an ensemble-space variational smoother that operates in the low-dimensional latent space of a pretrained differentiable neural dynamics surrogate. By performing four-dimensional ensemble-variational (4DEnVar) optimization within an ensemble subspace, LEVDA jointly assimilates states and unknown parameters without the need for adjoint code or auxiliary observation-to-latent encoders. Leveraging the fully differentiable, continuous-in-time-and-space nature of the surrogate, LEVDA naturally accommodates highly irregular sampling at arbitrary spatiotemporal locations. Across three challenging geophysical benchmarks, LEVDA matches or outperforms state-of-the-art latent filtering baselines under severe observational sparsity while providing more reliable uncertainty quantification. Simultaneously, it achieves substantially improved assimilation accuracy and computational efficiency compared to full-state 4DEnVar."}

Although general interactive segmentation models like SAM have achieved remarkable progress, their transfer to medical imaging still faces two key bottlenecks: (i) the lack of adaptive mechanisms for modality- and anatomy-specific tasks, which limits generalization in out-of-distribution medical scenarios; and (ii) current medical adaptation methods fine-tune on large, heterogeneous datasets without selection, leading to noisy supervision, higher cost, and negative transfer. To address these issues, we propose SegMoTE, an efficient and adaptive framework for medical image segmentation. SegMoTE preserves SAM's original prompt interface, efficient inference, and zero-shot generalization while introducing only a small number of learnable parameters to dynamically adapt across modalities and tasks. In addition, we design a progressive prompt tokenization mechanism that enables fully automatic segmentation, significantly reducing annotation dependence. Trained on MedSeg-HQ, a curated dataset less than 1% of existing large-scale datasets, SegMoTE achieves SOTA performance across diverse imaging modalities and anatomical tasks.

This is difficult to answer because client-specific data are high-dimensional and private, making centralization of raw data infeasible. Each client also maintains proprietary local models that cannot be modified. We propose a federated framework for causal representation learning in state-space systems that captures interdependencies among clients under these constraints. Each client maps high-dimensional observations into low-dimensional latent states that disentangle intrinsic dynamics from control-driven influences. A central server estimates the global state-transition and control structure. This enables decentralized counterfactual reasoning where clients predict how outputs would change under alternative control inputs at others while only exchanging compact latent states. We prove convergence to a centralized oracle and provide privacy guarantees. Our experiments demonstrate scalability, and accurate cross-client counterfactual inference on synthetic and real-world industrial control system datasets."}

This paper formulates liquidity management as an optimal control problem and derives the corresponding Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman quasi-variational inequality (HJB-QVI). We present an approximate solution RAmmStein, a Deep Reinforcement Learning method that incorporates the mean-reversion speed (theta) of an Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process among other features as input to the model.

We present a facial manipulation method that operates in the semantic latent space of a pre-trained face generator (Diffusion Autoencoder). Using lightweight linear models, we reduce entanglement of semantic features via (i) dependency-aware conditioning that accounts for AU co-activation, and (ii) orthogonal projection that removes nuisance attribute directions (e.g., glasses), together with an expression neutralization step to enable absolute AU edit. We use these edits to balance AU occurrence by editing labeled faces and to diversify identities/demographics via controlled synthesis. Augmenting AU detector training with the generated data improves accuracy and yields more disentangled predictions with fewer co-activation shortcuts, outperforming alternative data-efficient training strategies and suggesting improvements similar to what would require substantially more labeled data in our learning-curve analysis.

This challenge arises because diffusion models treat style as a global feature and lack explicit spatial grounding of style representations, making it difficult to restrict style application to specific objects or regions. To our knowledge, existing diffusion models are unable to perform true localized style transfer, typically relying on handcrafted masks or multi-stage post-processing that introduce boundary artifacts and limit generalization. To address this, we propose an attention-supervised diffusion framework that explicitly teaches the model where to apply a given style by aligning the attention scores of style tokens with object masks during training. Two complementary objectives, a Focus loss based on KL divergence and a Cover loss using binary cross-entropy, jointly encourage accurate localization and dense coverage. A modular LoRA-MoE design further enables efficient and scalable multi-style adaptation. To evaluate localized stylization, we introduce the Regional Style Editing Score, which measures Regional Style Matching through CLIP-based similarity within the target region and Identity Preservation via masked LPIPS and pixel-level consistency on unedited areas. Experiments show that our method achieves mask-free, single-object style transfer at inference, producing regionally accurate and visually coherent results that outperform existing diffusion-based editing approaches."}

To efficiently isolate minimal sufficient subsets, we adapt delta debugging, a systematic reduction strategy from software debugging, and configure its search strategy based on unit interactions in the classifier head: testing individual units for models with non-interacting units and testing unit combinations for models in which unit interactions exist. We then generate minimal, prediction-preserving saliency maps that highlight only the most essential features.

A central limitation for deep conformal classifiers is that the nonconformity scores are derived from softmax outputs, which can be unreliable indicators of how certain the model truly is about a given input, sometimes leading to overconfident misclassifications or undue hesitation. In this work, we argue that this unreliability can be inherited by the prediction sets generated by CP, limiting their capacity for adaptiveness. We propose a new approach that leverages information from the pre-softmax logit space, using the Helmholtz Free Energy as a measure of model uncertainty and sample difficulty. By reweighting nonconformity scores with a monotonic transformation of the energy score of each sample, we improve their sensitivity to input difficulty.

This problem is naturally formulated as a bilevel optimization task, where the outer loop optimizes domain weights to minimize validation loss, and the inner loop optimizes model parameters to minimize the weighted training loss. Classical bilevel optimization relies on hypergradients, which theoretically require the inner optimization to reach convergence. However, due to computational constraints, state-of-the-art methods use a finite, often small, number of inner update steps before updating the weights. The theoretical implications of this approximation are not well understood. In this work, we rigorously analyze the convergence behavior of data mixing with a finite number of inner steps $T$. We prove that the \"greedy\" practical approach of using $T=1$ can fail even in a simple quadratic example.

Directly training a generative model to capture the kinetics leads to two limitations: (a) Due to the absence of data on missing time, the model tends to overfit to irrelevant features, leading to content distortion.

We introduce a spectral diagnostic framework grounded in Random Matrix Theory (RMT) and Heavy-Tailed Self-Regularization (HTSR) that spans the ML taxonomy: weight matrices for BERT/ALBERT/Qwen2.5, out-of-fold increment matrices for XGBoost/Random Forest, empirical Hessians for Logistic Regression, induced affinity matrices for Decision Trees, and Graph Laplacians for KNN. Evaluating nine model families on two Iowa DOT crash classification tasks (173,512 and 371,062 records respectively), we find that the power-law exponent $α$ provides a structural quality signal: well-regularized models consistently yield $α$ within $[2, 4]$ (mean $2.87 \\pm 0.34$), while overfit variants show $α< 2$ or spectral collapse. We observe a strong rank correlation between $α$ and expert agreement (Spearman $ρ= 0.89$, $p < 0.001$), suggesting spectral quality captures model behaviors aligned with expert reasoning. We propose an $α$-based early stopping criterion and a spectral model selection protocol, and validate both against cross-validated F1 baselines. Sparse Lanczos approximations make the framework scalable to large datasets."}

Code: https://github.com/ahaliassos/usr2", "summary": "Unified Speech Recognition (USR) has emerged as a semi-supervised framework for training a single model for audio, visual, and audiovisual speech recognition, achieving state-of-the-art results on in-distribution benchmarks. However, its reliance on autoregressive pseudo-labelling makes training expensive, while its decoupled supervision of CTC and attention branches increases susceptibility to self-reinforcing errors, particularly under distribution shifts involving longer sequences, noise, or unseen domains. We propose CTC-driven teacher forcing, where greedily decoded CTC pseudo-labels are fed into the decoder to generate attention targets in a single forward pass. Although these can be globally incoherent, in the pseudo-labelling setting they enable efficient and effective knowledge transfer. Because CTC and CTC-driven attention pseudo-labels have the same length, the decoder can predict both simultaneously, benefiting from the robustness of CTC and the expressiveness of attention without costly beam search. We further propose mixed sampling to mitigate the exposure bias of the decoder relying solely on CTC inputs. The resulting method, USR 2.0, halves training time, improves robustness to out-of-distribution inputs, and achieves state-of-the-art results on LRS3, LRS2, and WildVSR, surpassing USR and modality-specific self-supervised baselines."}

While deep learning approaches often focus on temporal interpolation or complex architectures to handle irregularities, we propose a simpler yet effective alternative: extracting time-agnostic summary statistics to eliminate the temporal axis. Our method computes four key features per variable-mean and standard deviation of observed values, as well as the mean and variability of changes between consecutive observations to create a fixed-dimensional representation. These features are then utilized with standard classifiers, such as logistic regression and XGBoost. Evaluated on four biomedical datasets (PhysioNet Challenge 2012, 2019, PAMAP2, and MIMIC-III), our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance, surpassing recent transformer and graph-based models by 0.5-1.7% in AUROC/AUPRC and 1.1-1.7% in accuracy/F1-score, while reducing computational complexity. Ablation studies demonstrate that feature extraction-not classifier choice-drives performance gains, and our summary statistics outperform raw/imputed input in most benchmarks. In particular, we identify scenarios where missing patterns themselves encode predictive signals, as in sepsis prediction (PhysioNet, 2019), where missing indicators alone can achieve 94.2% AUROC with XGBoost, only 1.6% lower than using original raw data as input. Our results challenge the necessity of complex temporal modeling when task objectives permit time-agnostic representations, providing an efficient and interpretable solution for irregular time series classification."}

The low signal-to-noise ratio and stochastic speckle patterns hinder standard self-supervised learning methods relying on a pixel-level reconstruction objective. Joint-Embedding Predictive Architectures (JEPAs) address this drawback by predicting masked latent representations rather than raw pixels. However, standard approaches depend on hyperparameter-brittle and computationally expensive online teachers updated via exponential moving average. We propose US-JEPA, a self-supervised framework that adopts the Static-teacher Asymmetric Latent Training (SALT) objective. By using a frozen, domain-specific teacher to provide stable latent targets, US-JEPA decouples student-teacher optimization and pushes the student to expand upon the semantic priors of the teacher. In addition, we provide the first rigorous comparison of all publicly available state-of-the-art ultrasound foundation models on UltraBench, a public dataset benchmark spanning multiple organs and pathological conditions. Under linear probing for diverse classification tasks, US-JEPA achieves performance competitive with or superior to domain-specific and universal vision foundation model baselines.

While prior work on grokking has focused mainly on group operations, we extend the analysis to more general algebraic structures, including non-associative, non-commutative, and non-unital algebras. We show that learning group operations is a special case of learning FDA, and that learning multiplication in FDA amounts to learning a bilinear product specified by the algebra's structure tensor. For algebras over the reals, we connect the learning problem to matrix factorization with an implicit low-rank bias, and for algebras over finite fields, we show that grokking emerges naturally as models must learn discrete representations of algebraic elements. This leads us to experimentally investigate the following core questions: (i) how do algebraic properties such as commutativity, associativity, and unitality influence both the emergence and timing of grokking, (ii) how structural properties of the structure tensor of the FDA, such as sparsity and rank, influence generalization, and (iii) to what extent generalization correlates with the model learning latent embeddings aligned with the algebra's representation. Our work provides a unified framework for grokking across algebraic structures and new insights into how mathematical structure governs neural network generalization dynamics."}

However, recent studies reveal its vulnerability to adversarial corruptions in input views, where imperceptible yet consistent perturbations can drastically degrade rendering quality, increase training and rendering time, and inflate memory usage, even leading to server denial-of-service. In our work, to mitigate this issue, we begin by analyzing the distinct behaviors of adversarial perturbations in the low- and high-frequency components of input images using wavelet transforms. Based on this observation, we design a simple yet effective frequency-aware defense strategy that reconstructs training views by filtering high-frequency noise while preserving low-frequency content. This approach effectively suppresses adversarial artifacts while maintaining the authenticity of the original scene. Notably, it does not significantly impair training on clean data, achieving a desirable trade-off between robustness and performance on clean inputs. Through extensive experiments under a wide range of attack intensities on multiple benchmarks, we demonstrate that our method substantially enhances the robustness of 3DGS without access to clean ground-truth supervision. By highlighting and addressing the overlooked vulnerabilities of 3D Gaussian Splatting, our work paves the way for more robust and secure 3D reconstructions."}

Inspired by speculative decoding in language model inference and by the Automatically Scalable Computation (ASC) architecture for program execution, Leap+Verify decomposes training into three dynamically detected regimes (chaotic, transition, stable) using activation-space cosine similarity as a real-time Lyapunov proxy signal. Within each regime, analytic weight predictors (momentum, linear, quadratic extrapolation) attempt to forecast model parameters K training steps ahead; predictions are accepted only when validated against a held-out loss criterion. We evaluate Leap+Verify on GPT-2 124M and Qwen 2.5-1.5B trained on WikiText-103 across five random seeds, sweeping prediction depth K in {5, 10, 25, 50, 75, 100}. Momentum-based prediction (Adam moment extrapolation) fails catastrophically at both scales, with predicted losses exceeding actuals by 100-10,000x -- a universal norm explosion in optimizer-state extrapolation. Finite-difference predictors (linear, quadratic) succeed where momentum fails: at 124M, they achieve 24% strict acceptance at K=5 in stable regimes; at 1.5B, they achieve 37% strict acceptance in transition regimes. The scale-dependent finding is in regime distribution: GPT-2 124M spends 34% of training in stable regime, while Qwen 1.5B spends 64% in chaotic regime and reaches stable in only 0-2 of 40 checkpoints. Larger models are more predictable when predictable, but less often predictable -- the practical bottleneck shifts from predictor accuracy to regime availability. Cross-seed results are highly consistent (less than 1% validation loss variance), and the three-regime framework produces identical phase boundaries (plus or minus 50 steps) across seeds."}

Recent methods improve attack effectiveness by leveraging future rewards to guide adversarial perturbation generation over sequential time steps (i.e., reward-based attacks). However, these methods are unable to capture dependencies between different time steps in the perturbation generation process, resulting in a weak temporal correlation between the current perturbation and previous perturbations.In this paper, we propose a novel method called Advantage-based Adversarial Transformer (AAT), which can generate adversarial examples with stronger temporal correlations (i.e., time-correlated adversarial examples) to improve the attack performance. AAT employs a multi-scale causal self-attention (MSCSA) mechanism to dynamically capture dependencies between historical information from different time periods and the current state, thus enhancing the correlation between the current perturbation and the previous perturbation. Moreover, AAT introduces a weighted advantage mechanism, which quantifies the effectiveness of a perturbation in a given state and guides the generation process toward high-performance adversarial examples by sampling high-advantage regions. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the performance of AAT matches or surpasses mainstream adversarial attack baselines on Atari, DeepMind Control Suite and Google football tasks."}

Under adverse conditions, degradation or failure of the camera sensor can significantly compromise the reliability of the perception system. To address this problem, we introduce UP-Fuse, a novel uncertainty-aware fusion framework in the 2D range-view that remains robust under camera sensor degradation, calibration drift, and sensor failure. Raw LiDAR data is first projected into the range-view and encoded by a LiDAR encoder, while camera features are simultaneously extracted and projected into the same shared space. At its core, UP-Fuse employs an uncertainty-guided fusion module that dynamically modulates cross-modal interaction using predicted uncertainty maps. These maps are learned by quantifying representational divergence under diverse visual degradations, ensuring that only reliable visual cues influence the fused representation. The fused range-view features are decoded by a novel hybrid 2D-3D transformer that mitigates spatial ambiguities inherent to the 2D projection and directly predicts 3D panoptic segmentation masks. Extensive experiments on Panoptic nuScenes, SemanticKITTI, and our introduced Panoptic Waymo benchmark demonstrate the efficacy and robustness of UP-Fuse, which maintains strong performance even under severe visual corruption or misalignment, making it well suited for robotic perception in safety-critical settings."}

Within this context, rapid and accurate plume shine dose estimation serves as a practical test case, as it is critical for nuclear facility safety assessment and radiological emergency response, while conventional photon-transport-based calculations remain computationally expensive. In this work, an interpolation-assisted ML framework was developed using discrete dose datasets generated with the pyDOSEIA suite for 17 gamma-emitting radionuclides across varying downwind distances, release heights, and atmospheric stability categories. The datasets were augmented using shape-preserving interpolation to construct dense, high-resolution training data. Two tree-based ML models (Random Forest and XGBoost) and one deep learning (DL) model (TabNet) were evaluated to examine predictive performance and sensitivity to dataset resolution. All models showed higher prediction accuracy with the interpolated high-resolution dataset than with the discrete data; however, XGBoost consistently achieved the highest accuracy. Interpretability analysis using permutation importance (tree-based models) and attention-based feature attribution (TabNet) revealed that performance differences stem from how the models utilize input features. Tree-based models focus mainly on dominant geometry-dispersion features (release height, stability category, and downwind distance), treating radionuclide identity as a secondary input, whereas TabNet distributes attention more broadly across multiple variables. For practical deployment, a web-based GUI was developed for interactive scenario evaluation and transparent comparison with photon-transport reference calculations."}

Therefore, we combine both hard (execution-based) and soft (LLM-based) metrics to show that both are necessary for complete evaluation. While evaluating both closed and open-source coding agents, we find no single agent dominates across codebases.

We propose Closed-Loop Memory Correction (CL-MC), a detector-in-the-loop framework that supervises Segment Anything Model 2(SAM2) through confidence-aligned state decisions and active memory rectification. High-confidence detections trigger semantic resets that overwrite corrupted tracker memory, effectively mitigating drift accumulation with a training-free foundation tracker in complex endoscopic scenes.

We introduce a sampler-centric oracle framework that replaces learned denoisers with an exact Hidden Markov Model posterior derived from a ground-truth Markov chain, isolating sampler-induced error in a controlled setting. We show that few-step discrete diffusion samplers are not distributionally correct even under an oracle denoiser, with transition-level mismatch that vanishes only as the number of steps approaches the sequence length.

However, tackling long-tail pattern recognition tasks remains challenging for current pre-trained foundation models such as LLMs and VLMs. While finetuning pre-trained models can improve accuracy in recognizing implicit patterns, it is usually infeasible due to a lack of training data and high computational overhead. In this paper, we propose ADAMAB, an efficient embedding calibration framework for few-shot pattern recognition. To maximally reduce the computational costs, ADAMAB trains embedder-agnostic light-weight calibrators on top of fixed embedding models without accessing their parameters. To mitigate the need for large-scale training data, we introduce an adaptive data augmentation strategy based on the Multi-Armed Bandit (MAB) mechanism. With a modified upper confidence bound algorithm, ADAMAB diminishes the gradient shifting and offers theoretically guaranteed convergence in few-shot training. Our multi-modal experiments justify the superior performance of ADAMAB, with up to 40% accuracy improvement when training with less than 5 initial data samples of each class."}

One reason is the conventional down-sampling techniques that prioritize computational efficiency at the expense of information retention. This paper introduces a simple but effective strategy, we call it Stair Pooling, which moderates the pace of down-sampling and reduces information loss by leveraging a sequence of concatenated small and narrow pooling operations in varied orientations. Specifically, our method modifies the reduction in dimensionality within each 2D pooling step from $\\frac{1}{4}$ to $\\frac{1}{2}$. This approach can also be adapted for 3D pooling to preserve even more information. Such preservation aids the U-Net in more effectively reconstructing spatial details during the up-sampling phase, thereby enhancing its ability to capture long-range information and improving segmentation accuracy. Extensive experiments on three BIS benchmarks demonstrate that the proposed Stair Pooling can increase both 2D and 3D U-Net performance by an average of 3.8\\% in Dice scores. Moreover, we leverage the transfer entropy to select the optimal down-sampling paths and quantitatively show how the proposed Stair Pooling reduces the information loss."}

Rather than reasoning over primitive actions, we study agents that compose pre-trained policies as temporally extended actions, enabling solutions to complex tasks that no constituent alone can solve. Such compositional planning remains elusive as compounding errors in long-horizon predictions make it challenging to estimate the visitation distribution induced by sequencing policies. Motivated by the geometric policy composition framework introduced in arXiv:2206.08736, we address these challenges by learning predictive models of multi-step dynamics -- so-called jumpy world models -- that capture state occupancies induced by pre-trained policies across multiple timescales in an off-policy manner. Building on Temporal Difference Flows (arXiv:2503.09817), we enhance these models with a novel consistency objective that aligns predictions across timescales, improving long-horizon predictive accuracy. We further demonstrate how to combine these generative predictions to estimate the value of executing arbitrary sequences of policies over varying timescales. Empirically, we find that compositional planning with jumpy world models significantly improves zero-shot performance across a wide range of base policies on challenging manipulation and navigation tasks, yielding, on average, a 200% relative improvement over planning with primitive actions on long-horizon tasks."}

Prior white-box attacks rarely generalize across tasks, and black-box methods depend on expensive transfer, which limits efficiency. The vision encoder, standardized and often shared across LVLMs, provides a stable gray-box pivot with strong cross-model transfer. Building on this premise, we introduce PA-Attack (Prototype-Anchored Attentive Attack). PA-Attack begins with a prototype-anchored guidance that provides a stable attack direction towards a general and dissimilar prototype, tackling the attribute-restricted issue and limited task generalization of vanilla attacks. Building on this, we propose a two-stage attention enhancement mechanism: (i) leverage token-level attention scores to concentrate perturbations on critical visual tokens, and (ii) adaptively recalibrate attention weights to track the evolving attention during the adversarial process. Extensive experiments across diverse downstream tasks and LVLM architectures show that PA-Attack achieves an average 75.1% score reduction rate (SRR), demonstrating strong attack effectiveness, efficiency, and task generalization in LVLMs. Code is available at https://github.com/hefeimei06/PA-Attack."}

However, anonymization can negatively affect the performance of Computer Vision systems that rely on visual features, such as Content-Based Image Retrieval (CBIR). Despite this, the impact of anonymization on CBIR has not been systematically studied. This work addresses this gap, motivated by the DOKIQ project, an artificial intelligence-based system for document verification actively used by the State Criminal Police Office Baden-Württemberg. We propose a simple evaluation framework: retrieval results after anonymization should match those obtained before anonymization as closely as possible. To this end, we systematically assess the impact of anonymization using two public datasets and the internal DOKIQ dataset. Our experiments span three anonymization methods, four anonymization degrees, and four training strategies, all based on the state of the art backbone Self-Distillation with No Labels (DINO)v2. Our results reveal a pronounced retrieval bias in favor of models trained on original data, which produce the most similar retrievals after anonymization. The findings of this paper offer practical insights for developing privacy-compliant CBIR systems while preserving performance."}

However, the prevalent unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) strategies often demonstrate limited and biased performance, which hinders their practical applications. In this study, we explore sparse points and local human preferences as weak labels in the target domain, thereby presenting a more realistic yet annotation-efficient setting. Specifically, we develop Prefer-DAS, which pioneers sparse promptable learning and local preference alignment. The Prefer-DAS is a promptable multitask model that integrates self-training and prompt-guided contrastive learning. Unlike SAM-like methods, the Prefer-DAS allows for the use of full, partial, and even no point prompts during both training and inference stages and thus enables interactive segmentation. Instead of using image-level human preference alignment for segmentation, we introduce Local direct Preference Optimization (LPO) and sparse LPO (SLPO), plug-and-play solutions for alignment with spatially varying human feedback or sparse feedback. To address potential missing feedback, we also introduce Unsupervised Preference Optimization (UPO), which leverages self-learned preferences. As a result, the Prefer-DAS model can effectively perform both weakly-supervised and unsupervised DAS, depending on the availability of points and human preferences. Comprehensive experiments on four challenging DAS tasks demonstrate that our model outperforms SAM-like methods as well as unsupervised and weakly-supervised DAS methods in both automatic and interactive segmentation modes, highlighting strong generalizability and flexibility. Additionally, the performance of our model is very close to or even exceeds that of supervised models."}

Within a unified framework, we compare QK-DFT against alternative quantum variants (QK-PCA, QK-RP) and classi- cal SVM baselines under identical clean-data hyperparameter selection, quantifying robustness via dataset fixed-effects regression with wild cluster bootstrap inference across heterogeneous real-world datasets. Across the quantum family, DFT-based preprocessing yields the smallest degradation rate as noise increases, with statistically sup- ported slope differences relative to PCA and RP. Compared to classical baselines, QK-DFT shows degradation comparable to linear SVM and more stable than RBF SVM under matched tuning. Hardware exper- iments confirm that SPE remains executable and numerically stable for overlap estimation. These results indicate that robustness in quan- tum kernels depends critically on structure-aligned preprocessing and its interaction with diagonal embeddings, supporting a robustness-first perspective for NISQ-era quantum machine learning."}

In this paper, we introduce TherA, a controllable RGB-to-TIR translation framework that produces diverse and thermally plausible images at both scene and object level. TherA couples TherA-VLM with a latent-diffusion-based translator. Given a single RGB image and a user-prompted condition pair, TherA-VLM yields a thermal-aware embedding that encodes scene, object, material, and heat-emission context reflecting the input scene-condition pair. Conditioning the diffusion model on this embedding enables realistic TIR synthesis and fine-grained control across time of day, weather, and object state.

The agent maintains a persistent state vector across executions and incrementally updates it as new textual data is introduced. We quantify representational change using cosine similarity between successive normalized state vectors and define a stability metric over time intervals. Longitudinal experiments across eight executions reveal a transition from an initial plastic regime to a stable representational regime under consistent input. A deliberately introduced semantic perturbation produces a bounded decrease in similarity, followed by recovery and restabilization under subsequent coherent input. These results demonstrate that meaningful stability plasticity tradeoffs can emerge in a minimal, stateful learning system without explicit regularization, replay, or architectural complexity. The work establishes a transparent empirical baseline for studying representational accumulation and adaptation in continual learning systems."}

CountEx enables users to express both inclusion and exclusion intent, specifying what to count and what to ignore, through multimodal prompts including natural language descriptions and optional visual exemplars.

To address these challenges, we propose FinSight-Net, an efficient and physics-aware detection framework tailored for complex aquaculture environments. FinSight-Net introduces a Multi-Scale Decoupled Dual-Stream Processing (MS-DDSP) bottleneck that explicitly targets frequency-specific information loss via heterogeneous convolutional branches, suppressing backscattering artifacts while compensating distorted biological cues through scale-aware and channel-weighted pathways.

A fundamental challenge is that high-throughput single-cell sequencing is destructive: the same cell cannot be observed both before and after a perturbation. Thus, perturbation prediction requires mapping unpaired control and perturbed populations. Existing models address this by learning maps between distributions, but typically assume a single fixed response distribution when conditioned on observed cellular context (e.g., cell type) and the perturbation type. In reality, responses vary systematically due to unobservable latent factors such as microenvironmental fluctuations and complex batch effects, forming a manifold of possible distributions for the same observed conditions. To account for this variability, we introduce PerturbDiff, which shifts modeling from individual cells to entire distributions. By embedding distributions as points in a Hilbert space, we define a diffusion-based generative process operating directly over probability distributions. This allows PerturbDiff to capture population-level response shifts across hidden factors. Benchmarks on established datasets show that PerturbDiff achieves state-of-the-art performance in single-cell response prediction and generalizes substantially better to unseen perturbations.

We introduce CRAFT (Codebook RegulAted Fine-Tuning), a lightweight method that fine-tunes the encoder using a discrete codebook that anchors visual representations to a stable token space, achieving domain adaptation without modifying other parts of the model. This decoupled design allows the adapted encoder to seamlessly boost the performance of LVLMs with different language architectures, as long as they share the same codebook. Empirically, CRAFT achieves an average gain of 13.51% across 10 domain-specific benchmarks such as VQARAD and PlantVillage, while preserving the LLM's linguistic capabilities and outperforming peer methods that operate on continuous tokens."}

In safety-critical medical segmentation, this lack of selectivity often causes the tumor mask to spill into healthy brain tissue or degrades predictions that were already correct. We propose Hypothesis-Driven TTA, a novel framework that reformulates adaptation as a dynamic decision process. Rather than forcing a single optimization trajectory, our method generates intuitive competing geometric hypotheses: compaction (is the prediction noisy? trim artifacts) versus inflation (is the valid tumor under-segmented? safely inflate to recover). It then employs a representation-guided selector to autonomously identify the safest outcome based on intrinsic texture consistency. Additionally, a pre-screening Gatekeeper prevents negative transfer by skipping adaptation on confident cases. We validate this proof-of-concept on a cross-domain binary brain tumor segmentation task, applying a source model trained on adult BraTS gliomas to unseen pediatric and more challenging meningioma target domains. HD-TTA improves safety-oriented outcomes (Hausdorff Distance (HD95) and Precision) over several state-of-the-art representative baselines in the challenging safety regime, reducing the HD95 by approximately 6.4 mm and improving Precision by over 4%, while maintaining comparable Dice scores. These results demonstrate that resolving the safety-adaptation trade-off via explicit hypothesis selection is a viable, robust path for safe clinical model deployment.

Optical metrology techniques such as deflectometry achieve high accuracy but typically rely on multi-shot acquisition, making them unsuitable for dynamic environments. Fourier-based single-shot approaches alleviate this constraint, yet their performance deteriorates when measuring surfaces with high spatial frequency structure or large curvature. Alternatively, polarimetric 3D imaging in computer vision operates in a single-shot fashion and exhibits robustness to geometric complexity. However, its accuracy is fundamentally limited by the orthographic imaging assumption. In this paper, we propose a physics-informed deep learning framework for single-shot 3D imaging of complex specular surfaces. Polarization cues provide orientation priors that assist in interpreting geometric information encoded by structured illumination. These complementary cues are processed through a dual-encoder architecture with mutual feature modulation, allowing the network to resolve their nonlinear coupling and directly infer surface normals. The proposed method achieves accurate and robust normal estimation in single-shot with fast inference, enabling practical 3D imaging of complex specular surfaces."}

Taking into account that conventional SFDA methods are inevitably error-prone under domain shift, recently greater attention has been directed to SFDA assisted with off-the-shelf foundation models, e.g., vision-language (ViL) models. However, existing works of leveraging ViL models for SFDA confront two issues: (i) Although mutual information is exploited to consider the joint distribution between the predictions of ViL model and the target model, we argue that the forgetting of some superior predictions of the target model still occurs, as indicated by the decline of the accuracies of certain classes during adaptation; (ii) Prior research disregards the rich, fine-grained knowledge embedded in the ViL model, which offers detailed grounding for fundus image diagnosis. In this paper, we introduce a novel forgetting-resistant and lesion-aware (FRLA) method for SFDA of fundus image diagnosis with ViL model. Specifically, a forgetting-resistant adaptation module explicitly preserves the confident predictions of the target model, and a lesion-aware adaptation module yields patch-wise predictions from ViL model and employs them to help the target model be aware of the lesion areas and leverage the ViL model's fine-grained knowledge. Extensive experiments show that our method not only significantly outperforms the vision-language model, but also achieves consistent improvements over the state-of-the-art methods.

To ground our position, we provide indicative estimates of the energy use and carbon emissions associated with the downstream use of ImageNet-1K. We then present empirical evidence that data frugality is both practical and beneficial, demonstrating that coreset-based subset selection can substantially reduce training energy consumption with little loss in accuracy, while also mitigating dataset bias.

Recent forecasting-based caching approaches employ temporal extrapolation techniques to approximate the output features with cached ones. Although effective, relying exclusively on temporal extrapolation still suffers from significant prediction errors, leading to performance degradation. Through a detailed analysis, we find that 1) these errors stem from the irregular magnitude of changes in the output features, and 2) an input feature of a module is strongly correlated with the corresponding output. Based on this, we propose relational feature caching (RFC), a novel framework that leverages the input-output relationship to enhance the accuracy of the feature prediction. Specifically, we introduce relational feature estimation (RFE) to estimate the magnitude of changes in the output features from the inputs, enabling more accurate feature predictions.

Traditional simulation methods, such as phase-field models, offer high-fidelity results but are computationally expensive due to the need to solve complex partial differential equations at fine spatiotemporal resolutions. To address this challenge, we propose a deep learning-based framework that accelerates microstructure evolution predictions while maintaining high accuracy. Our approach utilizes a fully convolutional spatiotemporal model trained in a self-supervised manner using sequential images generated from simulations of microstructural processes, including grain growth and spinodal decomposition. The trained neural network effectively learns the underlying physical dynamics and can accurately capture both short-term local behaviors and long-term statistical properties of evolving microstructures, while also demonstrating generalization to unseen spatiotemporal domains and variations in configuration and material parameters. Compared to recurrent neural architectures, our model achieves state-of-the-art predictive performance with significantly reduced computational cost in both training and inference. This work establishes a robust baseline for spatiotemporal learning in materials science and offers a scalable, data-driven alternative for fast and reliable microstructure simulations."}

However, previous Mamba-based methods utilize the bidirectional encoding for the whole non-empty voxel sequence, which contains abundant useless background information in the scenes. Though directly encoding foreground voxels appears to be a plausible solution, it tends to degrade detection performance. We attribute this to the response attenuation and restricted context representation in the linear modeling for fore-only sequences. To address this problem, we propose a novel backbone, termed Fore-Mamba3D, to focus on the foreground enhancement by modifying Mamba-based encoder. The foreground voxels are first sampled according to the predicted scores. Considering the response attenuation existing in the interaction of foreground voxels across different instances, we design a regional-to-global slide window (RGSW) to propagate the information from regional split to the entire sequence. Furthermore, a semantic-assisted and state spatial fusion module (SASFMamba) is proposed to enrich contextual representation by enhancing semantic and geometric awareness within the Mamba model. Our method emphasizes foreground-only encoding and alleviates the distance-based and causal dependencies in the linear autoregression model. The superior performance across various benchmarks demonstrates the effectiveness of Fore-Mamba3D in the 3D object detection task."}

However, training under this paradigm presents its own challenge: the extrapolation error stemming from out-of-distribution (OOD) data. Existing methodologies have endeavored to address this issue through means like penalizing OOD Q-values or imposing similarity constraints on the learned policy and the behavior policy. Nonetheless, these approaches are often beset by limitations such as being overly conservative in utilizing OOD data, imprecise OOD data characterization, and significant computational overhead. To address these challenges, this paper introduces an Uncertainty-Aware Rank-One Multi-Input Multi-Output (MIMO) Q Network framework. The framework aims to enhance Offline Reinforcement Learning by fully leveraging the potential of OOD data while still ensuring efficiency in the learning process. Specifically, the framework quantifies data uncertainty and harnesses it in the training losses, aiming to train a policy that maximizes the lower confidence bound of the corresponding Q-function. Furthermore, a Rank-One MIMO architecture is introduced to model the uncertainty-aware Q-function, \\TP{offering the same ability for uncertainty quantification as an ensemble of networks but with a cost nearly equivalent to that of a single network}. Consequently, this framework strikes a harmonious balance between precision, speed, and memory efficiency, culminating in improved overall performance. Extensive experimentation on the D4RL benchmark demonstrates that the framework attains state-of-the-art performance while remaining computationally efficient. By incorporating the concept of uncertainty quantification, our framework offers a promising avenue to alleviate extrapolation errors and enhance the efficiency of offline RL."}

We investigate whether simple, household-accessible cosmetic changes, including beards, grey hair, makeup, and simulated wrinkles, can cause AI age estimators to classify minors as adults. To study this threat at scale without ethical concerns, we simulate these physical attacks on 329 facial images of individuals aged 10 to 21 using a VLM image editor (Gemini 2.5 Flash Image). We then evaluate eight models from our prior benchmark: five specialized architectures (MiVOLO, Custom-Best, Herosan, MiViaLab, DEX) and three vision-language models (Gemini 3 Flash, Gemini 2.5 Flash, GPT-5-Nano). We introduce the Attack Conversion Rate (ACR), defined as the fraction of images predicted as minor at baseline that flip to adult after attack, a population-agnostic metric that does not depend on the ratio of minors to adults in the test set. Our results reveal that a synthetic beard alone achieves 28 to 69 percent ACR across all eight models; combining all four attacks shifts predicted age by +7.7 years on average across all 329 subjects and reaches up to 83 percent ACR; and vision-language models exhibit lower ACR (59 to 71 percent) than specialized models (63 to 83 percent) under the full attack, although the ACR ranges overlap and the difference is not statistically tested.

Through systematic experiments, we show that diffusion models offer representations that are both diverse and partially robust, and that explicitly incorporating diffusion representations as an auxiliary learning signal during AT consistently improves robustness across settings.

Given a 3D asset and an editing prompt, Vinedresser3D uses a multimodal large language model to infer rich descriptions of the original asset, identify the edit region and edit type (addition, modification, deletion), and generate decomposed structural and appearance-level text guidance. The agent then selects an informative view and applies an image editing model to obtain visual guidance. Finally, an inversion-based rectified-flow inpainting pipeline with an interleaved sampling module performs editing in the 3D latent space, enforcing prompt alignment while maintaining 3D coherence and unedited regions.

Instead of operating in a continuous domain, DICArt progressively denoises a noisy pose representation through a learned reverse diffusion procedure to recover the GT pose. To improve modeling fidelity, we propose a flexible flow decider that dynamically determines whether each token should be denoised or reset, effectively balancing the real and noise distributions during diffusion. Additionally, we incorporate a hierarchical kinematic coupling strategy, estimating the pose of each rigid part hierarchically to respect the object's kinematic structure. We validate DICArt on both synthetic and real-world datasets. Experimental results demonstrate its superior performance and robustness.

Random network distillation (RND) is a lightweight technique that measures novelty via prediction errors against a fixed random target. While empirically effective, it has remained unclear what uncertainties RND measures and how its estimates relate to other approaches, e.g. Bayesian inference or deep ensembles. This paper establishes these missing theoretical connections by analyzing RND within the neural tangent kernel framework in the limit of infinite network width. Our analysis reveals two central findings in this limit: (1) The uncertainty signal from RND -- its squared self-predictive error -- is equivalent to the predictive variance of a deep ensemble. (2) By constructing a specific RND target function, we show that the RND error distribution can be made to mirror the centered posterior predictive distribution of Bayesian inference with wide neural networks. Based on this equivalence, we moreover devise a posterior sampling algorithm that generates i.i.d. samples from an exact Bayesian posterior predictive distribution using this modified \\textit{Bayesian RND} model.

In this paper, we propose ConceptPrism, a novel framework that automatically disentangles the shared visual concept from image-specific residuals by comparing images within a set. Our method jointly optimizes a target token and image-wise residual tokens using two complementary objectives: a reconstruction loss to ensure fidelity, and a novel exclusion loss that compels residual tokens to discard the shared concept.

However, the ill-posed nature of PDE inverse problems makes them highly sensitive to noise. Even a small fraction of corrupted observations can distort internal neural representations, severely impairing accuracy and destabilizing training. Motivated by recent advances in machine unlearning and structured network pruning, we propose P-PINN, a selective pruning framework designed to unlearn the influence of corrupted data in a pretrained PINN. Specifically, starting from a PINN trained on the full dataset, P-PINN evaluates a joint residual--data fidelity indicator, a weighted combination of data misfit and PDE residuals, to partition the training set into reliable and corrupted subsets. Next, we introduce a bias-based neuron importance measure that quantifies directional activation discrepancies between the two subsets, identifying neurons whose representations are predominantly driven by corrupted samples. Building on this, an iterative pruning strategy then removes noise-sensitive neurons layer by layer. The resulting pruned network is fine-tuned on the reliable data subject to the original PDE constraints, acting as a lightweight post-processing stage rather than a complete retraining. Numerical experiments on extensive PDE inverse-problem benchmarks demonstrate that P-PINN substantially improves robustness, accuracy, and training stability under noisy conditions, achieving up to a 96.6\\% reduction in relative error compared with baseline PINNs.

In this work, we investigate the distinct emergent mechanisms that arise when training AR versus Non-Autoregressive (NAR) models, such as Discrete Diffusion Models (dLLMs), on lookahead tasks. By requiring the models to plan ahead to reach the correct conclusion, we analyze how these two paradigms fundamentally differ in their approach to the problem. We identify a critical asymmetry in planning problems: while forward generation requires complex lookahead at branching junctions, reverse generation is often deterministic. This asymmetry creates an opportunity for NAR models. Through mechanistic analysis of training and inference dynamics, we demonstrate that NAR models learn to solve planning tasks by utilizing future tokens to decode backwards, avoiding the need to learn complex traversal mechanisms entirely. Consequently, we report that both AR and NAR models are able to achieve perfect accuracy on the lookahead task. However, NAR models require exponentially fewer training examples and shallower architectures compared to AR models, which often fail to converge without specific curriculum adjustments."}

However, existing methods that project all modalities into a single latent space for fusion often overlook the asynchronous, multi-level semantic structure of multimodal data. This oversight induces semantic misalignment and error propagation, thereby degrading representation quality. To address this issue, we propose Cross-Level Co-Representation (CLCR), which explicitly organizes each modality's features into a three-level semantic hierarchy and specifies level-wise constraints for cross-modal interactions. First, a semantic hierarchy encoder aligns shallow, mid, and deep features across modalities, establishing a common basis for interaction. And then, at each level, an Intra-Level Co-Exchange Domain (IntraCED) factorizes features into shared and private subspaces and restricts cross-modal attention to the shared subspace via a learnable token budget. This design ensures that only shared semantics are exchanged and prevents leakage from private channels. To integrate information across levels, the Inter-Level Co-Aggregation Domain (InterCAD) synchronizes semantic scales using learned anchors, selectively fuses the shared representations, and gates private cues to form a compact task representation. We further introduce regularization terms to enforce separation of shared and private features and to minimize cross-level interference. Experiments on six benchmarks spanning emotion recognition, event localization, sentiment analysis, and action recognition show that CLCR achieves strong performance and generalizes well across tasks."}

However, DFL faces three critical challenges: privacy leakage from honest-but-curious neighbors, slow convergence due to the lack of central coordination, and vulnerability to Byzantine adversaries aiming to degrade model accuracy. To address these issues, we propose a novel DFL framework that integrates Byzantine robustness, privacy preservation, and convergence acceleration. Within this framework, each device trains a local model using a Bayesian approach and independently selects an optimal subset of neighbors for posterior exchange. We formulate this neighbor selection as an optimization problem to minimize the global loss function under security and privacy constraints. Solving this problem is challenging because devices only possess partial network information, and the complex coupling between topology, security, and convergence remains unclear. To bridge this gap, we first analytically characterize the trade-offs between dynamic connectivity, Byzantine detection, privacy levels, and convergence speed. Leveraging these insights, we develop a fully distributed Graph Neural Network (GNN)-based Reinforcement Learning (RL) algorithm. This approach enables devices to make autonomous connection decisions based on local observations. Simulation results demonstrate that our method achieves superior robustness and efficiency with significantly lower overhead compared to traditional security and privacy schemes."}

In this paper, we introduce an efficient plug-and-play module that substantially improves VLMs' reasoning over rare objects by refining visual tokens and enriching input text prompts, without VLMs finetuning. Specifically, we propose to learn multi-modal class embeddings for rare objects by leveraging prior knowledge from vision foundation models and synonym-augmented text descriptions, compensating for limited training examples. These embeddings refine the visual tokens in VLMs through a lightweight attention-based enhancement module that improves fine-grained object details. In addition, we use the learned embeddings as object-aware detectors to generate informative hints, which are injected into the text prompts to help guide the VLM's attention toward relevant image regions. Experiments on two benchmarks show consistent and substantial gains for pretrained VLMs in rare object recognition and reasoning.

In practice, feature learning plays an important role across both stages: deep neural networks learn a broad range of useful features during pretraining and further refine those features during fine-tuning. However, an end-to-end theoretical understanding of how choices of initialization impact the ability to reuse and refine features during fine-tuning has remained elusive. Here we develop an analytical theory of the pretraining-fine-tuning pipeline in diagonal linear networks, deriving exact expressions for the generalization error as a function of initialization parameters and task statistics. We find that different initialization choices place the network into four distinct fine-tuning regimes that are distinguished by their ability to support feature learning and reuse, and therefore by the task statistics for which they are beneficial. In particular, a smaller initialization scale in earlier layers enables the network to both reuse and refine its features, leading to superior generalization on fine-tuning tasks that rely on a subset of pretraining features. We demonstrate empirically that the same initialization parameters impact generalization in nonlinear networks trained on CIFAR-100. Overall, our results demonstrate analytically how data and network initialization interact to shape fine-tuning generalization, highlighting an important role for the relative scale of initialization across different layers in enabling continued feature learning during fine-tuning."}

The first two authors contributed equally", "summary": "Recent advances in text-to-image (T2I) diffusion models have seen rapid and widespread adoption. However, their powerful generative capabilities raise concerns about potential misuse for synthesizing harmful, private, or copyrighted content. To mitigate such risks, concept erasure techniques have emerged as a promising solution. Prior works have primarily focused on fine-tuning the denoising component (e.g., the U-Net backbone). However, recent causal tracing studies suggest that visual attribute information is localized in the early self-attention layers of the text encoder, indicating a potential alternative for concept erasing. Building on this insight, we conduct preliminary experiments and find that directly fine-tuning early layers can suppress target concepts but often degrades the generation quality of non-target concepts. To overcome this limitation, we propose High-Level Representation Misdirection (HiRM), which misdirects high-level semantic representations of target concepts in the text encoder toward designated vectors such as random directions or semantically defined directions (e.g., supercategories), while updating only early layers that contain causal states of visual attributes. Our decoupling strategy enables precise concept removal with minimal impact on unrelated concepts, as demonstrated by strong results on UnlearnCanvas and NSFW benchmarks across diverse targets (e.g., objects, styles, nudity). HiRM also preserves generative utility at low training cost, transfers to state-of-the-art architectures such as Flux without additional training, and shows synergistic effects with denoiser-based concept erasing methods."}

BarrierSteer employs a steering mechanism based on Control Barrier Functions (CBFs) to efficiently detect and prevent unsafe response trajectories during inference with high precision. By enforcing multiple safety constraints through efficient constraint merging, without modifying the underlying LLM parameters, BarrierSteer preserves the model's original capabilities and performance. We provide theoretical results establishing that applying CBFs in latent space offers a principled and computationally efficient approach to enforcing safety.

Second, the reconstruction process is primarily driven by local geometric proximity, neglecting the human and object appearances that provide global context crucial for understanding holistic interactions. To address these issues, we introduce TeHOR, a framework built upon two core designs. First, beyond contact information, our framework leverages text descriptions of human-object interactions to enforce semantic alignment between the 3D reconstruction and its textual cues, enabling reasoning over a wider spectrum of interactions, including non-contact cases.

In this work, we introduce a distribution-agnostic unmasking schedule for DLMs that adapts to the (unknown) dependence structure of the target data distribution, without requiring any prior knowledge or hyperparameter tuning. In contrast to prior deterministic procedures that fix unmasking sizes, our method randomizes the number of tokens revealed at each iteration. We show that, for two specific parameter choices, the sampling convergence guarantees -- measured by Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence -- scale as $\\widetilde O(\\mathsf{TC}/K)$ and $\\widetilde O(\\mathsf{DTC}/K)$ respectively.

Traditional volumetric fusion techniques, including truncated signed distance functions (TSDF), enable efficient and deterministic geometry reconstruction; however, they depend on heuristic weighting and fail to transparently convey uncertainty in a systematic way. Recent neural implicit methods, on the other hand, get very high fidelity but usually need a lot of GPU power for optimization and aren't very easy to understand for making decisions later on. This work presents BayesFusion-SDF, a CPU-centric probabilistic signed distance fusion framework that conceptualizes geometry as a sparse Gaussian random field with a defined posterior distribution over voxel distances. First, a rough TSDF reconstruction is used to create an adaptive narrow-band domain. Then, depth observations are combined using a heteroscedastic Bayesian formulation that is solved using sparse linear algebra and preconditioned conjugate gradients. Randomized diagonal estimators are a quick way to get an idea of posterior uncertainty. This makes it possible to extract surfaces and plan the next best view while taking into account uncertainty. Tests on a controlled ablation scene and a CO3D object sequence show that the new method is more accurate geometrically than TSDF baselines and gives useful estimates of uncertainty for active sensing. The proposed formulation provides a clear and easy-to-use alternative to GPU-heavy neural reconstruction methods while still being able to be understood in a probabilistic way and acting in a predictable way.

By establishing the equivalence between the optimal policy update and an advantage-based target distribution, we derive a practical LAD objective formulated as minimizing an $f$-divergence between the policy-induced and advantage-induced distributions. This yields a gradient update that increases likelihood for high-advantage responses while suppressing over-confident probability growth, preventing collapse without requiring auxiliary entropy regularization. LAD incurs no extra training cost compared to GRPO and scales naturally to LLM post-training.

BL parameterizes a compositional utility function built from intrinsically interpretable modular blocks, which induces a data distribution for prediction and generation. Each block represents and can be written in symbolic form as a utility maximization problem (UMP), a foundational paradigm in behavioral science and a universal framework of optimization. BL supports architectures ranging from a single UMP to hierarchical compositions, the latter modeling hierarchical optimization structures. Its smooth and monotone variant (IBL) guarantees identifiability. Theoretically, we establish the universal approximation property of BL, and analyze the M-estimation properties of IBL.

To obtain less biased and more reliable models under such scarcity, practitioners leverage diffusion models to supplement underrepresented regions of real data. Specifically, recent studies fine-tune pretrained diffusion models with LoRA on few-shot real sets to synthesize additional images. While an image-wise LoRA trained on a single image captures fine-grained details yet offers limited diversity, a class-wise LoRA trained over all shots produces diverse images as it encodes class priors yet tends to overlook fine details. To combine both benefits, we separate the adapter into a class-shared LoRA~$A$ for class priors and per-image LoRAs~$\\mathcal{B}$ for image-specific characteristics. To expose coherent class semantics in the shared LoRA~$A$, we propose a semantic boosting by preserving class bounding boxes during training.

Feature disentanglement is a promising approach to mitigate shortcut learning by separating task-relevant information from confounder-related features in latent representations. In this study, we systematically evaluated feature disentanglement methods for mitigating shortcuts in medical imaging, including adversarial learning and latent space splitting based on dependence minimization. We assessed classification performance and disentanglement quality using latent space analyses across one artificial and two medical datasets with natural and synthetic confounders. We also examined robustness under varying levels of confounding and compared computational efficiency across methods. We found that shortcut mitigation methods improved classification performance under strong spurious correlations during training. Latent space analyses revealed differences in representation quality not captured by classification metrics, highlighting the strengths and limitations of each method. Model reliance on shortcuts depended on the degree of confounding in the training data. The best-performing models combine data-centric rebalancing with model-centric disentanglement, achieving stronger and more robust shortcut mitigation than rebalancing alone while maintaining similar computational efficiency."}

Recent unified synthesis models have enabled flexible synthesis tasks by accommodating various input-output configurations. However, their training and evaluation are typically restricted to a single dataset, limiting their generalizability across diverse clinical datasets and impeding practical deployment. To address this limitation, we propose PMM-Synth, a personalized MRI synthesis framework that not only supports various synthesis tasks but also generalizes effectively across heterogeneous datasets. PMM-Synth is jointly trained on multiple multi-modal MRI datasets that differ in modality coverage, disease types, and intensity distributions. It achieves cross-dataset generalization through three core innovations: a Personalized Feature Modulation module that dynamically adapts feature representations based on dataset identifier to mitigate the impact of distributional shifts; a Modality-Consistent Batch Scheduler that facilitates stable and efficient batch training under inconsistent modality conditions; and a selective supervision loss to ensure effective learning when ground truth modalities are partially missing. Evaluated on four clinical multi-modal MRI datasets, PMM-Synth consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both one-to-one and many-to-one synthesis tasks, achieving superior PSNR and SSIM scores. Qualitative results further demonstrate improved preservation of anatomical structures and pathological details. Additionally, downstream tumor segmentation and radiological reporting studies suggest that PMM-Synth holds potential for supporting reliable diagnosis under real-world modality-missing scenarios."}

The scene tokens are predicted by a multi-view tokenizer given many context views and rendered into novel views by employing a light-weight rectified flow decoder. We show that the compression is 1-3 orders of magnitude stronger than for other representations while still reaching state-of-the-art reconstruction quality. Further, our representation can be rendered from novel trajectories, including ones deviating from the input trajectory, and we show that the decoder gracefully handles uncertainty.

While inter-modality fusion of camera and LiDAR data in multimodal place recognition (MPR) has shown promise in overcoming the limitations of unimodal counterparts, existing MPR methods basically attend to hand-crafted fusion strategies and heavily parameterized backbones that require costly retraining. To address this, we propose VGGT-MPR, a multimodal place recognition framework that adopts the Visual Geometry Grounded Transformer (VGGT) as a unified geometric engine for both global retrieval and re-ranking. In the global retrieval stage, VGGT extracts geometrically-rich visual embeddings through prior depth-aware and point map supervision, and densifies sparse LiDAR point clouds with predicted depth maps to improve structural representation. This enhances the discriminative ability of fused multimodal features and produces global descriptors for fast retrieval. Beyond global retrieval, we design a training-free re-ranking mechanism that exploits VGGT's cross-view keypoint-tracking capability. By combining mask-guided keypoint extraction with confidence-aware correspondence scoring, our proposed re-ranking mechanism effectively refines retrieval results without additional parameter optimization. Extensive experiments on large-scale autonomous driving benchmarks and our self-collected data demonstrate that VGGT-MPR achieves state-of-the-art performance, exhibiting strong robustness to severe environmental changes, viewpoint shifts, and occlusions.

We first introduce a layered motion representation that disentangles rigid motion from residual non-rigid motion. Rigid motion is generated by a kinematic method, which then produces a coarse rendering to guide the video diffusion model in generating video sequences that restore the residual non-rigid motion. However, this restoration task, based on diffusion sampling, is highly challenging, as the initial renderings are out-of-distribution, causing standard deterministic ODE samplers to fail. Therefore, we propose a novel self-guided stochastic sampling method, which effectively addresses the out-of-distribution problem by combining stochastic sampling (for photorealistic quality) with self-guidance (for identity fidelity). These restored videos provide high-quality supervision, enabling the optimization of the residual non-rigid motion field.

However, the iterative refinement and densification process leads to the generation of a large number of primitives, each contributing to the reconstruction to a substantially different extent. Estimating primitive importance is thus crucial, both for removing redundancy during reconstruction and for enabling efficient compression and transmission. Existing methods typically rely on rendering-based analyses, where each primitive is evaluated through its contribution across multiple camera viewpoints. However, such methods are sensitive to the number and selection of views, rely on specialized differentiable rasterizers, and have long calculation times that grow linearly with view count, making them difficult to integrate as plug-and-play modules and limiting scalability and generalization. To address these issues, we propose RAP, a fast feedforward rendering-free attribute-guided method for efficient importance score prediction in 3DGS. RAP infers primitive significance directly from intrinsic Gaussian attributes and local neighborhood statistics, avoiding rendering-based or visibility-dependent computations. A compact MLP predicts per-primitive importance scores using rendering loss, pruning-aware loss, and significance distribution regularization. After training on a small set of scenes, RAP generalizes effectively to unseen data and can be seamlessly integrated into reconstruction, compression, and transmission pipelines.

Previous methods often use techniques such as diffusion models and adversarial learning to reduce the modality gap, but they typically focus on one-to-one alignment without exposing the data points of the source modality to the global distribution information of the target modality. To this end, leveraging the characteristic of rectified flow that can map one distribution to another via a straight trajectory, we extend rectified flow for modality distribution mapping. Specifically, we leverage the `one-to-many mapping' strategy in rectified flow that allows each data point of the source modality to observe the overall target distribution. This also alleviates the issue of insufficient paired data within each sample, enabling a more robust distribution transformation. Moreover, to achieve more accurate distribution mapping and address the ambiguous flow directions in one-to-many mapping, we design `adaptive relaxed alignment', enforcing stricter alignment for modality pairs belonging to the same sample, while applying relaxed mapping for pairs not belonging to the same sample or category. Additionally, to prevent information loss during distribution mapping, we introduce `cyclic rectified flow' to ensure the transferred features can be translated back to the original features, allowing multimodal representations to learn sufficient modality-specific information. After distribution alignment, our approach achieves very competitive results on multiple tasks of multimodal affective computing even with a simple fusion method, and visualizations verify that it can effectively reduce the modality gap."}

We present a facial manipulation method that operates in the semantic latent space of a pre-trained face generator (Diffusion Autoencoder).

Using perceptual metrics (SSIM, LPIPS, ViTScore) and structural metrics (SIFT/ORB feature matching), we find that BANet-3D produces the best overall quality (SSIM = 0.883, LPIPS = 0.157), while RAFT-Stereo scores highest on scene-level understanding (ViTScore = 0.799). Testing on an NVIDIA Jetson Orin Super (16 GB, independently powered) mounted on our drone shows that AnyNet reaches 6.99 FPS at 1080P -- the only near-real-time option -- while BANet-2D gives the best quality-speed balance at 1.21 FPS. We also compare 720P and 1080P processing times to guide resolution choices for forestry drone systems."}

The low signal-to-noise ratio and stochastic speckle patterns hinder standard self-supervised learning methods relying on a pixel-level reconstruction objective. Joint-Embedding Predictive Architectures (JEPAs) address this drawback by predicting masked latent representations rather than raw pixels. However, standard approaches depend on hyperparameter-brittle and computationally expensive online teachers updated via exponential moving average. We propose US-JEPA, a self-supervised framework that adopts the Static-teacher Asymmetric Latent Training (SALT) objective. By using a frozen, domain-specific teacher to provide stable latent targets, US-JEPA decouples student-teacher optimization and pushes the student to expand upon the semantic priors of the teacher. In addition, we provide the first rigorous comparison of all publicly available state-of-the-art ultrasound foundation models on UltraBench, a public dataset benchmark spanning multiple organs and pathological conditions. Under linear probing for diverse classification tasks, US-JEPA achieves performance competitive with or superior to domain-specific and universal vision foundation model baselines. Our results demonstrate that masked latent prediction provides a stable and efficient path toward robust ultrasound representations."}

Existing methods struggle to support free exploration, often producing severe geometric distortions and noisy artifacts when the viewpoint moves far from the original perspective. We introduce \\textbf{One2Scene}, an effective framework that decomposes this ill-posed problem into three tractable sub-tasks to enable immersive explorable scene generation. We first use a panorama generator to produce anchor views from a single input image as initialization. Then, we lift these 2D anchors into an explicit 3D geometric scaffold via a generalizable, feed-forward Gaussian Splatting network. Instead of treating the panorama as a single image for reconstruction, we project it into multiple sparse anchor views and reformulate the reconstruction task as multi-view stereo matching, which allows us to leverage robust geometric priors learned from large-scale multi-view datasets. A bidirectional feature fusion module is used to enforce cross-view consistency, yielding an efficient and geometrically reliable scaffold. Finally, the scaffold serves as a strong prior for a novel view generator to produce photorealistic and geometrically accurate views at arbitrary cameras. By explicitly conditioning on a 3D-consistent scaffold to perform reconstruction, One2Scene works stably under large camera motions, supporting immersive scene exploration. Extensive experiments show that One2Scene substantially outperforms state-of-the-art methods in panorama depth estimation, feed-forward 360° reconstruction, and explorable 3D scene generation.

In this paper, we propose ADAMAB, an efficient embedding calibration framework for few-shot pattern recognition. To maximally reduce the computational costs, ADAMAB trains embedder-agnostic light-weight calibrators on top of fixed embedding models without accessing their parameters. To mitigate the need for large-scale training data, we introduce an adaptive data augmentation strategy based on the Multi-Armed Bandit (MAB) mechanism. With a modified upper confidence bound algorithm, ADAMAB diminishes the gradient shifting and offers theoretically guaranteed convergence in few-shot training. Our multi-modal experiments justify the superior performance of ADAMAB, with up to 40% accuracy improvement when training with less than 5 initial data samples of each class."}

Transvaginal ultrasound serves as the primary, accessible screening modality in resource-constrained primary care settings; however, its diagnostic reliability is severely hindered by low tissue contrast, high operator dependence, and a pronounced scarcity of positive pathological samples. Existing artificial intelligence solutions struggle to overcome this severe class imbalance and the subtle imaging features of invasion, particularly under the strict computational limits of primary care clinics. Here we present an automated, highly efficient two-stage deep learning framework that resolves both data and computational bottlenecks in EC screening. To mitigate pathological data scarcity, we develop a structure-guided cross-modal generation network that synthesizes diverse, high-fidelity ultrasound images from unpaired magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) data, strictly preserving clinically essential anatomical junctions. Furthermore, we introduce a lightweight screening network utilizing gradient distillation, which transfers discriminative knowledge from a high-capacity teacher model to dynamically guide sparse attention towards task-critical regions.

Recent forecasting-based caching approaches employ temporal extrapolation techniques to approximate the output features with cached ones. Although effective, relying exclusively on temporal extrapolation still suffers from significant prediction errors, leading to performance degradation. Through a detailed analysis, we find that 1) these errors stem from the irregular magnitude of changes in the output features, and 2) an input feature of a module is strongly correlated with the corresponding output. Based on this, we propose relational feature caching (RFC), a novel framework that leverages the input-output relationship to enhance the accuracy of the feature prediction. Specifically, we introduce relational feature estimation (RFE) to estimate the magnitude of changes in the output features from the inputs, enabling more accurate feature predictions. We also present relational cache scheduling (RCS), which estimates the prediction errors using the input features and performs full computations only when the errors are expected to be substantial.

To this end, we introduce TextShield-R1, the first reinforcement learning based MLLM solution for tampered text detection and reasoning.

At inference time, we enhance localization accuracy via OCR Rectification, a method that leverages the MLLM's strong text recognition abilities to refine its predictions. Furthermore, to support rigorous evaluation, we introduce the Text Forensics Reasoning (TFR) benchmark, comprising over 45k real and tampered images across 16 languages, 10 tampering techniques, and diverse domains. Rich reasoning-style annotations are included, allowing for comprehensive assessment.

We investigate whether simple, household-accessible cosmetic changes, including beards, grey hair, makeup, and simulated wrinkles, can cause AI age estimators to classify minors as adults. To study this threat at scale without ethical concerns, we simulate these physical attacks on 329 facial images of individuals aged 10 to 21 using a VLM image editor (Gemini 2.5 Flash Image). We then evaluate eight models from our prior benchmark: five specialized architectures (MiVOLO, Custom-Best, Herosan, MiViaLab, DEX) and three vision-language models (Gemini 3 Flash, Gemini 2.5 Flash, GPT-5-Nano). We introduce the Attack Conversion Rate (ACR), defined as the fraction of images predicted as minor at baseline that flip to adult after attack, a population-agnostic metric that does not depend on the ratio of minors to adults in the test set. Our results reveal that a synthetic beard alone achieves 28 to 69 percent ACR across all eight models; combining all four attacks shifts predicted age by +7.7 years on average across all 329 subjects and reaches up to 83 percent ACR; and vision-language models exhibit lower ACR (59 to 71 percent) than specialized models (63 to 83 percent) under the full attack, although the ACR ranges overlap and the difference is not statistically tested.

Although multimodal forecasting has emerged as a viable mitigation strategy, existing architectures predominantly rely on shallow feature concatenation and binary cloud segmentation, thereby failing to capture the fine-grained optical features of clouds and the complex spatiotemporal coupling between visual and meteorological modalities. To bridge this gap, this paper proposes M3S-Net, a novel multimodal feature fusion network based on multi-scale data for ultra-short-term PV power forecasting. First, a multi-scale partial channel selection network leverages partial convolutions to explicitly isolate the boundary features of optically thin clouds, effectively transcending the precision limitations of coarse-grained binary masking. Second, a multi-scale sequence to image analysis network employs Fast Fourier Transform (FFT)-based time-frequency representation to disentangle the complex periodicity of meteorological data across varying time horizons. Crucially, the model incorporates a cross-modal Mamba interaction module featuring a novel dynamic C-matrix swapping mechanism. By exchanging state-space parameters between visual and temporal streams, this design conditions the state evolution of one modality on the context of the other, enabling deep structural coupling with linear computational complexity, thus overcoming the limitations of shallow concatenation. Experimental validation on the newly constructed fine-grained PV power dataset demonstrates that M3S-Net achieves a mean absolute error reduction of 6.2% in 10-minute forecasts compared to state-of-the-art baselines.

This phenomenon, known as the modality gap, has been partially mitigated for standard text and image pairs but remains unknown and unresolved in more complex multimodal settings, such as the medical domain. In this work, we study this phenomenon in the latter case, revealing that the modality gap is present also in medical alignment, and we propose a modality-agnostic framework that closes this gap, ensuring that semantically related representations are more aligned, regardless of their source modality.

Extensive experiments across multiple VLMs and benchmarks demonstrate that ApET retains 95.2% of the original performance on image-understanding tasks and even attains 100.4% on video-understanding tasks, while compressing the token budgets by 88.9% and 87.5%, respectively. Thanks to its attention-free design, ApET seamlessly integrates with FlashAttention, enabling further inference acceleration and making VLM deployment more practical.

This challenge has led to OOD detection methods that aim to identify and reject unreliable predictions. Although prior work shows that OOD detection performance varies by artefact type, the underlying causes remain underexplored. To this end, we identify a previously unreported bias in OOD detection: for hard-to-detect artefacts (near-OOD), detection performance typically improves when the artefact shares visual similarity (e.g. colour) with the model's ROI and drops when it does not - a phenomenon we term the Invisible Gorilla Effect. For example, in a skin lesion classifier with red lesion ROI, we show the method Mahalanobis Score achieves a 31.5% higher AUROC when detecting OOD red ink (similar to ROI) compared to black ink (dissimilar) annotations. We annotated artefacts by colour in 11,355 images from three public datasets (e.g. ISIC) and generated colour-swapped counterfactuals to rule out dataset bias. We then evaluated 40 OOD methods across 7 benchmarks and found significant performance drops for most methods when artefacts differed from the ROI. Our findings highlight an overlooked failure mode in OOD detection and provide guidance for more robust detectors.

This allows us to provide pose descriptions that are more accurate than previous state-of-the-art surface-based animal tracking methods. From the original dataset, we derive BigMaQ500, an action recognition benchmark that links surface-based pose vectors to single frames across multiple individual monkeys. By pairing features extracted from established image and video encoders with and without our pose descriptors, we demonstrate substantial improvements in mean average precision (mAP) when pose information is included.

Due to these assumptions, such methods fail to generalise beyond a few change types, limiting their real-world usage, especially in rare or complex scenarios. To address this, we propose MaSoN (Make Some Noise), an end-to-end UCD framework that synthesises diverse changes directly in the latent feature space during training. It generates changes that are dynamically estimated using feature statistics of target data, enabling diverse yet data-driven variation aligned with the target domain. It also easily extends to new modalities, such as SAR.

Using multi-view DynamicFusion, we fuse noisy, non-rigid point cloud sequences into high-fidelity 3D scans, overcoming challenges from irregular surfaces and rapid movement.

Existing intermediate signals for portrait generation, such as 2D landmarks and parametric models, have limited disentanglement capabilities and cannot express personalized details due to their sparse or low-rank representation. Therefore, existing methods based on these models struggle to accurately preserve subject identity and expressions, hindering the generation of highly expressive portrait videos. To overcome these limitations, we propose a high-fidelity personalized head representation that more effectively disentangles expression and identity. This representation captures both static, subject-specific global geometry and dynamic, expression-related details. Furthermore, we introduce an expression transfer module to achieve personalized transfer of head pose and expression details between different identities. We use this sophisticated and highly expressive head model as a conditional signal to train a diffusion transformer (DiT)-based generator to synthesize richly detailed portrait videos. Extensive experiments on self- and cross-reenactment tasks demonstrate that our method outperforms previous models in terms of identity preservation, expression accuracy, and temporal stability, particularly in capturing fine-grained details of complex motion."}

A more intuitive approach is to select samples with similar disease severity characteristics, since these samples are more likely to have similar structures related to the progression of a disease. To enable this, we introduce a method that generates disease severity labels for unlabeled OCT scans on the basis of gradient responses from an anomaly detection algorithm. These labels are used to train a supervised contrastive learning setup to improve biomarker classification accuracy by as much as 6% above self-supervised baselines for key indicators of Diabetic Retinopathy."}

Due to the flexibility, neural implicit fields have succeeded in many research areas, including shape reconstruction, novel view image synthesis, and more recently, object pose estimation. Neural implicit fields enable learning dense correspondences between the camera space and the object's canonical space-including unobserved regions in camera space-significantly boosting object pose estimation performance in challenging scenarios like highly occluded objects and novel shapes. Despite progress, predicting canonical coordinates for unobserved camera-space regions remains challenging due to the lack of direct observational signals. This necessitates heavy reliance on the model's generalization ability, resulting in high uncertainty. Consequently, densely sampling points across the entire camera space may yield inaccurate estimations that hinder the learning process and compromise performance. To alleviate this problem, we propose a method combining an SO(3)-equivariant convolutional implicit network and a positive-incentive point sampling (PIPS) strategy. The SO(3)-equivariant convolutional implicit network estimates point-level attributes with SO(3)-equivariance at arbitrary query locations, demonstrating superior performance compared to most existing baselines. The PIPS strategy dynamically determines sampling locations based on the input, thereby boosting the network's accuracy and training efficiency.

We generate large-scale synthetic datasets using state-of-the-art T2I models released between 2022 and 2025, train standard classifiers solely on this synthetic data, and evaluate them on real test data.

While optical sensors such as Camera and Lidar struggle in adverse weather conditions, Radar provides a more robust perception performance, effectively penetrating fog, rain, and snow.

Additionally, deep learning methods show potential to extract richer and more dense features from low level Radar data and therefore significantly increase the perception performance. Therefore, we propose a 3D projection method for fast-Fourier-transformed 4D Range-Azimuth-Doppler-Elevation (RADE) tensors. Our method preserves rich Doppler and Elevation features while reducing the required data size for a single frame by 91.9% compared to a full tensor, thus achieving higher training and inference speed as well as lower model complexity. We introduce RADE-Net, a lightweight model tailored to 3D projections of the RADE tensor. The backbone enables exploitation of low-level and high-level cues of Radar tensors with spatial and channel-attention. The decoupled detection heads predict object center-points directly in the Range-Azimuth domain and regress rotated 3D bounding boxes from rich feature maps in the cartesian scene. We evaluate the model on scenes with multiple different road users and under various weather conditions on the large-scale K-Radar dataset and achieve a 16.7% improvement compared to their baseline, as well as 6.5% improvement over current Radar-only models.

Conventional supervised losses are limited in capturing these correlations because they treat each joint independently. Previous studies have attempted to promote structural consistency through manually designed priors or rule-based constraints; however, these approaches typically require manual specification and are often non-differentiable, limiting their use as end-to-end training objectives. We propose SEAL-pose, a data-driven framework in which a learnable loss-net trains a pose-net by evaluating structural plausibility. Rather than relying on hand-crafted priors, our joint-graph-based design enables the loss-net to learn complex structural dependencies directly from data. Extensive experiments on three 3D HPE benchmarks with eight backbones show that SEAL-pose reduces per-joint errors and improves pose plausibility compared with the corresponding backbones across all settings.

Conventional countermeasures, which jointly optimize the encoder and decoder via a noise layer, face 2 inevitable challenges: (1) decrease of clean accuracy due to decoder adversarial training and (2) limited robustness due to simultaneous training of all three advanced attacks. To overcome these issues, we propose AdvMark, a novel two-stage fine-tuning framework that decouples the defense strategies. In stage 1, we address adversarial vulnerability via a tailored adversarial training paradigm that primarily fine-tunes the encoder while only conditionally updating the decoder. This approach learns to move the image into a non-attackable region, rather than modifying the decision boundary, thus preserving clean accuracy. In stage 2, we tackle distortion and regeneration attacks via direct image optimization. To preserve the adversarial robustness gained in stage 1, we formulate a principled, constrained image loss with theoretical guarantees, which balances the deviation from cover and previous encoded images. We also propose a quality-aware early-stop to further guarantee the lower bound of visual quality. Extensive experiments demonstrate AdvMark outperforms with the highest image quality and comprehensive robustness, i.e. up to 29\\%, 33\\% and 46\\% accuracy improvement for distortion, regeneration and adversarial attacks, respectively."}

Recent studies demonstrate that anchor-guided generative models are effective in modeling the uncertainty of driving behaviors and improving overall performance. However, these methods rely on discrete anchor vocabularies that must sufficiently cover the trajectory distribution during testing to ensure robustness, inducing an inherent trade-off between vocabulary size and model performance. To overcome this limitation, we propose MeanFuser, an end-to-end autonomous driving method that enhances both efficiency and robustness through three key designs. (1) We introduce Gaussian Mixture Noise (GMN) to guide generative sampling, enabling a continuous representation of the trajectory space and eliminating the dependency on discrete anchor vocabularies. (2) We adapt ``MeanFlow Identity\" to end-to-end planning, which models the mean velocity field between GMN and trajectory distribution instead of the instantaneous velocity field used in vanilla flow matching methods, effectively eliminating numerical errors from ODE solvers and significantly accelerating inference. (3) We design a lightweight Adaptive Reconstruction Module (ARM) that enables the model to implicitly select from all sampled proposals or reconstruct a new trajectory when none is satisfactory via attention weights. Experiments on the NAVSIM closed-loop benchmark demonstrate that MeanFuser achieves outstanding performance without the supervision of the PDM Score. and exceptional inference efficiency, offering a robust and efficient solution for end-to-end autonomous driving.

Although prior work shows that OOD detection performance varies by artefact type, the underlying causes remain underexplored. To this end, we identify a previously unreported bias in OOD detection: for hard-to-detect artefacts (near-OOD), detection performance typically improves when the artefact shares visual similarity (e.g. colour) with the model's ROI and drops when it does not - a phenomenon we term the Invisible Gorilla Effect. For example, in a skin lesion classifier with red lesion ROI, we show the method Mahalanobis Score achieves a 31.5% higher AUROC when detecting OOD red ink (similar to ROI) compared to black ink (dissimilar) annotations. We annotated artefacts by colour in 11,355 images from three public datasets (e.g. ISIC) and generated colour-swapped counterfactuals to rule out dataset bias. We then evaluated 40 OOD methods across 7 benchmarks and found significant performance drops for most methods when artefacts differed from the ROI. Our findings highlight an overlooked failure mode in OOD detection and provide guidance for more robust detectors.

We investigate two different strategies, (1) warped semantic features and (2) an alternating scheme of understanding and generation at each denoising step.

We extend this principle to vision-language alignment, showing that isolating and aligning structural cues across modalities can greatly benefit fine-tuning on long, detail-rich captions, with a specific focus on improving cross-modal retrieval. We introduce StructXLIP, a fine-tuning alignment paradigm that extracts edge maps (e.g., Canny), treating them as proxies for the visual structure of an image, and filters the corresponding captions to emphasize structural cues, making them \"structure-centric\". Fine-tuning augments the standard alignment loss with three structure-centric losses: (i) aligning edge maps with structural text, (ii) matching local edge regions to textual chunks, and (iii) connecting edge maps to color images to prevent representation drift. From a theoretical standpoint, while standard CLIP maximizes the mutual information between visual and textual embeddings, StructXLIP additionally maximizes the mutual information between multimodal structural representations. This auxiliary optimization is intrinsically harder, guiding the model toward more robust and semantically stable minima, enhancing vision-language alignment.

Yet, MU research for vision tasks has largely centered on CNNs, not VTs. While benchmarking MU efforts have addressed LLMs, diffusion models, and CNNs, none exist for VTs. This work is the first to attempt this, benchmarking MU algorithm performance in different VT families (ViT and Swin-T) and at different capacities.

En route, the work characterizes how VTs memorize training data relative to CNNs, and assesses the impact of different memorization proxies on performance. The benchmark uses unified evaluation metrics that capture two complementary notions of forget quality along with accuracy on unseen (test) data and on retained data.

Our probabilistic field-of-view and occlusion models incorporate head and shoulder rotation angles to create speed-dependent vision maps for individual players in a two-dimensional top-down plane. We combine these vision maps with pitch control and pitch value surfaces to analyze the awaiting phase (when a player is awaiting the ball to arrive after a pass for a teammate) and their subsequent on-ball phase. We demonstrate that aggregated visual metrics - such as the percentage of defended area observed while awaiting a pass - are predictive of controlled pitch value gained at the end of dribbling actions using 32 games of synchronized pose-enhanced tracking data and on-ball event data from the 2024 Copa America.

We show that this assumption breaks down in parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) methods such as LoRA. In this setting, the induced optimization geometry exhibits strong cross-parameter coupling with non-trivial off-diagonal interactions, while the task-relevant update directions are confined to a low-dimensional subspace.

Furthermore, our results demonstrate that models rely on mask structure and weight initialization to varying degrees."}

To leverage these benefits, neural networks require intrinsic and efficient components that operate directly in hyperbolic space. In this work, we lift two core components of neural networks, Multinomial Logistic Regression (MLR) and Fully Connected (FC) layers, into hyperbolic space via Busemann functions, resulting in Busemann MLR (BMLR) and Busemann FC (BFC) layers with a unified mathematical interpretation. BMLR provides compact parameters, a point-to-horosphere distance interpretation, batch-efficient computation, and a Euclidean limit, while BFC generalizes FC and activation layers with comparable complexity. Experiments on image classification, genome sequence learning, node classification, and link prediction demonstrate improvements in effectiveness and efficiency over prior hyperbolic layers.

We address these issues at the root by replacing VQ with a simple, principled, and fully differentiable alternative: an online PCA bottleneck trained via Oja's rule. The resulting model, PCA-VAE, learns an orthogonal, variance-ordered latent basis without codebooks, commitment losses, or lookup noise. Despite its simplicity, PCA-VAE exceeds VQ-GAN and SimVQ in reconstruction quality on CelebAHQ while using 10-100x fewer latent bits. It also produces naturally interpretable dimensions (e.g., pose, lighting, gender cues) without adversarial regularization or disentanglement objectives. These results suggest that PCA is a viable replacement for VQ: mathematically grounded, stable, bit-efficient, and semantically structured, offering a new direction for generative models beyond vector quantization."}

However, existing methods primarily rely on shallow behavioral signals, encoding items solely through surface-level textual features such as titles and descriptions. This reliance results in a critical Shallow Interest problem: the model fails to capture the latent, semantically rich interests underlying user interactions, limiting both personalization depth and recommendation interpretability. DeepInterestGR introduces three key innovations: (1) Multi-LLM Interest Mining (MLIM): We leverage multiple frontier LLMs along with their multi-modal variants to extract deep textual and visual interest representations through Chain-of-Thought prompting. (2) Reward-Labeled Deep Interest (RLDI): We employ a lightweight binary classifier to assign reward labels to mined interests, enabling effective supervision signals for reinforcement learning. (3) Interest-Enhanced Item Discretization (IEID): The curated deep interests are encoded into semantic embeddings and quantized into SID tokens via RQ-VAE. We adopt a two-stage training pipeline: supervised fine-tuning aligns the generative model with deep interest signals and collaborative filtering patterns, followed by reinforcement learning with GRPO optimized by our Interest-Aware Reward. Experiments on three Amazon Review benchmarks demonstrate that DeepInterestGR consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines across HR@K and NDCG@K metrics."}

It is known that such iterative feedback can lead to model collapse, yet the mechanisms underlying this degeneration remain poorly understood. Here we show that a broad class of feedback processes converges to a low-dimensional invariant structure in latent space, a phenomenon we call neural resonance. By modeling iterative feedback as a Markov Chain, we show that two conditions are needed for this resonance to occur: ergodicity of the feedback process and directional contraction of the latent representation. By studying diffusion models on MNIST and ImageNet, as well as CycleGAN and an audio feedback experiment, we map how local and global manifold geometry evolve, and we introduce an eight-pattern taxonomy of collapse behaviors. Neural resonance provides a unified explanation for long-term degenerate behavior in generative models and provides practical diagnostics for identifying, characterizing, and eventually mitigating collapse."}

Central to our framework is a trajectory-level objective that jointly trains the score network and learns $M_t(θ)$, which encompasses general parameterization classes of matrix-valued noise schedules. We further derive an estimator for the derivative with respect to $θ$ of the score that enables efficient optimization of the $M_t(θ)$ schedule. For inference, we develop an efficiently-implementable reverse-ODE solver that is an anisotropic generalization of the second-order Heun discretization algorithm. Across CIFAR-10, AFHQv2, FFHQ, and ImageNet-64, our method consistently improves upon the baseline EDM model in all NFE regimes.

In this work, we extend the role of diffusion models beyond merely generating synthetic data, examining whether their internal representations, which encode meaningful features of the data, can provide additional benefits for robust classifier training. Through systematic experiments, we show that diffusion models offer representations that are both diverse and partially robust, and that explicitly incorporating diffusion representations as an auxiliary learning signal during AT consistently improves robustness across settings. Furthermore, our representation analysis indicates that incorporating diffusion models into AT encourages more disentangled features, while diffusion representations and diffusion-generated synthetic data play complementary roles in shaping representations. Experiments on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and ImageNet validate these findings, demonstrating the effectiveness of jointly leveraging diffusion representations and synthetic data within AT."}
