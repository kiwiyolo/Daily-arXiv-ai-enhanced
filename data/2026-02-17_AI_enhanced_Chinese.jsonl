However, the tension between the limited communication bandwidth and the rich sensor information hinders its practical deployment. Recent studies have explored selection strategies that share only a subset of features per frame while striving to keep the performance on par. Nevertheless, the bandwidth requirement still stresses current wireless technologies. To fundamentally ease the tension, we take a proactive approach, exploiting the temporal continuity to identify features that capture environment dynamics, while avoiding repetitive and redundant transmission of static information. By incorporating temporal awareness, agents are empowered to dynamically adapt the sharing quantity according to environment complexity. We instantiate this intuition into an adaptive selection framework, COOPERTRIM, which introduces a novel conformal temporal uncertainty metric to gauge feature relevance, and a data-driven mechanism to dynamically determine the sharing quantity. To evaluate COOPERTRIM, we take semantic segmentation and 3D detection as example tasks. Across multiple open-source cooperative segmentation and detection models, COOPERTRIM achieves up to 80.28% and 72.52% bandwidth reduction respectively while maintaining a comparable accuracy. Relative to other selection strategies, COOPERTRIM also improves IoU by as much as 45.54% with up to 72% less bandwidth. Combined with compression strategies, COOPERTRIM can further reduce bandwidth usage to as low as 1.46% without compromising IoU performance.

We present a data-efficient framework that accelerates CPA cocktail design by combining high-throughput screening with an active-learning loop based on multi-objective Bayesian optimization. From an initial set of measured cocktails, we train probabilistic surrogate models to predict concentration and viability and quantify uncertainty across candidate formulations. We then iteratively select the next experiments by prioritizing cocktails expected to improve the Pareto front, maximizing expected Pareto improvement under uncertainty, and update the models as new assay results are collected. Wet-lab validation shows that our approach efficiently discovers cocktails that simultaneously achieve high CPA concentrations and high post-exposure viability.

These findings demonstrate that effective depth, not nominal depth, is the operative quantity governing depth's role as a productive scaling dimension in convolutional networks.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

Most prior work identifies circuits at the task level by averaging across many prompts, implicitly assuming a single stable mechanism per task. We show that this assumption can obscure a crucial source of structure: circuits are prompt-specific, even within a fixed task. Building on attention causal communication (ACC) (Franco & Crovella, 2025), we introduce ACC++, refinements that extract cleaner, lower-dimensional causal signals inside attention heads from a single forward pass. Like ACC, our approach does not require replacement models (e.g., SAEs) or activation patching; ACC++ further improves circuit precision by reducing attribution noise. Applying ACC++ to indirect object identification (IOI) in GPT-2, Pythia, and Gemma 2, we find there is no single circuit for IOI in any model: different prompt templates induce systematically different mechanisms. Despite this variation, prompts cluster into prompt families with similar circuits, and we propose a representative circuit for each family as a practical unit of analysis. Finally, we develop an automated interpretability pipeline that uses ACC++ signals to surface human-interpretable features and assemble mechanistic explanations for prompt families behavior. Together, our results recast circuits as a meaningful object of study by shifting the unit of analysis from tasks to prompts, enabling scalable circuit descriptions in the presence of prompt-specific mechanisms.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

Magnetic resonance urography (MRU) can visualize hydronephrosis, including renal pelvis and calyces, by utilizing the natural contrast provided by water. Existing voxel-based segmentation approaches can extract CH regions from MRU, facilitating disease diagnosis and prognosis. However, these segmentation methods predominantly focus on morphological features, such as size, shape, and structure. To enable functional assessments, such as urodynamic simulations, external complex post-processing steps are required to convert these results into mesh-level representations. To address this limitation, we propose an end-to-end method based on deep neural networks, namely KidMesh, which could automatically reconstruct CH meshes directly from MRU. Generally, KidMesh extracts feature maps from MRU images and converts them into feature vertices through grid sampling. It then deforms a template mesh according to these feature vertices to generate the specific CH meshes of MRU images. Meanwhile, we develop a novel schema to train KidMesh without relying on accurate mesh-level annotations, which are difficult to obtain due to the sparsely sampled MRU slices. Experimental results show that KidMesh could reconstruct CH meshes in an average of 0.4 seconds, and achieve comparable performance to conventional methods without requiring post-processing. The reconstructed meshes exhibited no self-intersections, with only 3.7% and 0.2% of the vertices having error distances exceeding 3.2mm and 6.4mm, respectively.

A standard approach is principal component analysis (PCA), but PCA relies on matrix multiplications; on resource-constrained systems, the multiplication count itself can become a bottleneck. Element selection eliminates this cost because the reduction consists only of selecting elements, and thus the key challenge is to determine which elements should be retained. We evaluate a candidate subset through the minimum mean-squared error of linear regression that predicts a target vector from the selected elements, where the target may be, for example, a one-hot label vector in classification. When an explicit target is unavailable, the input itself can be used as the target, yielding a reconstruction-based criterion. The resulting optimization is combinatorial, and exhaustive search is impractical. To address this, we derive an efficient formula for the objective change caused by swapping a selected and an unselected element, using the matrix inversion lemma, and we perform a swap-based local search that repeatedly applies objective-decreasing swaps until no further improvement is possible.

Time series chain has the great potential to reveal latent unusual evolving trend in the time series, or identify precursor of important events in a complex system. Unfortunately, existing definitions of time series chains only consider finding chains in a single time series. As a result, they are likely to miss unexpected evolving patterns in interrupted time series, or across two related time series.

Leveraging crash records from the Miami metropolitan area, Florida, and 220,000 street view images, evidence shows that greenery proportion exerts a significant and robust negative causal effect on traffic crashes (Average Treatment Effect = -6.38, p = 0.005). This protective effect exhibits spatial heterogeneity, being most pronounced in densely populated and socially vulnerable urban cores. While greenery significantly mitigates angle and rear-end crashes, its protective benefit for vulnerable road users (VRUs) remains limited. Our findings provide causal evidence for greening as a potential safety intervention, prioritizing hazardous visual environments while highlighting the need for distinct design optimizations to protect VRUs.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

Airborne systems face a key challenge in extracting geomagnetic field data: the aircraft itself induces magnetic noise. Although the classical Tolles-Lawson model addresses this, it inadequately handles stochastically corrupted magnetic data required for navigation. To address stochastic noise, we propose a framework based on two physics-based constraints: divergence-free vector field and E(3)-equivariance. These ensure the learned magnetic field obeys Maxwell's equations and that outputs transform correctly with sensor position/orientation. The divergence-free constraint is implemented by training a neural network to output a vector potential $A$, with the magnetic field defined as its curl. For E(3)-equivariance, we use tensor products of geometric tensors representable via spherical harmonics with known rotational transformations. Enforcing physical consistency and restricting the admissible function space acts as an implicit regularizer that improves spatio-temporal performance.

In doing so, it transforms fragmented historical observations into continuous, parameterized knowledge representations.

In this work, we propose Cast-R1, a learned time series forecasting framework that reformulates forecasting as a sequential decision-making problem. Cast-R1 introduces a memory-based state management mechanism that maintains decision-relevant information across interaction steps, enabling the accumulation of contextual evidence to support long-horizon reasoning.

We present a large-scale systematic study using a novel video dataset from 1,888 participants (727 with PD), comprising 32,847 videos across 16 standardized clinical tasks. We evaluate seven state-of-the-art VFMs -- including VideoPrism, V-JEPA, ViViT, and VideoMAE -- to determine their robustness in clinical screening. By evaluating frozen embeddings with a linear classification head, we demonstrate that task saliency is highly model-dependent: VideoPrism excels in capturing visual speech kinematics (no audio) and facial expressivity, while V-JEPA proves superior for upper-limb motor tasks. Notably, TimeSformer remains highly competitive for rhythmic tasks like finger tapping. Our experiments yield AUCs of 76.4-85.3% and accuracies of 71.5-80.6%.

It predicts that an algorithm has small generalization error if it is insensitive to small perturbations in the training set such as the removal or replacement of a training point. While stability has been demonstrated for numerous well-known algorithms, this framework has had limited success in analyses of deep neural networks. In this paper we study the algorithmic stability of deep ReLU homogeneous neural networks that achieve zero training error using parameters with the smallest $L_2$ norm, also known as the minimum-norm interpolation, a phenomenon that can be observed in overparameterized models trained by gradient-based algorithms. We investigate sufficient conditions for such networks to be stable. We find that 1) such networks are stable when they contain a (possibly small) stable sub-network, followed by a layer with a low-rank weight matrix, and 2) such networks are not guaranteed to be stable even when they contain a stable sub-network, if the following layer is not low-rank. The low-rank assumption is inspired by recent empirical and theoretical results which demonstrate that training deep neural networks is biased towards low-rank weight matrices, for minimum-norm interpolation and weight-decay regularization.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

Motivated by this finding, we propose AdaVBoost, a token-level visual attention boosting framework that adaptively determines how much attention to boost at each generation step.

For inter-clip camera consistency, we propose a temporal camera representation in the noise space that enables precise and stable camera motion control, along with a text-to-image initialization mechanism to further enhance controllability. For inter-shot consistency, DCDM adopts a holistic scene generation paradigm with windowed cross-attention and sparse inter-shot self-attention, ensuring long-range narrative coherence while maintaining computational efficiency.

We introduce a personalized data acquisition strategy in which an RL agent, given a partially observed multi-view study, selects the next view to acquire or terminates acquisition to support heart-failure (HF) assessment. Upon termination, a diagnostic model jointly predicts aortic stenosis (AS) severity and left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF), two key HF biomarkers, and outputs uncertainty, enabling an explicit trade-off between diagnostic performance and acquisition cost. Methods: We model POCUS as a sequential acquisition problem: at each step, a video selector (RL agent) chooses the next view to acquire or terminates acquisition. Upon termination, a shared multi-view transformer performs multi-task inference with two heads, ordinal AS classification, and LVEF regression, and outputs Gaussian predictive distributions yielding ordinal probabilities over AS classes and EF thresholds.

Extensive experiments and analysis demonstrate that EchoTorrent achieves few-pass autoregressive generation with substantially extended temporal consistency, identity preservation, and audio-lip synchronization.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

For a fixed stepsize, the iterates typically admit a stationary distribution that is rarely tractable. Prior work shows that as the stepsize $\u03b1\\downarrow 0$, the centered-and-scaled steady state converges weakly to a Gaussian random vector. However, for fixed $\u03b1$, this weak convergence offers no usable error bound for approximating the steady-state by its Gaussian limit. This paper provides explicit, non-asymptotic error bounds for fixed $\u03b1$. We first prove general-purpose theorems that bound the Wasserstein distance between the centered-scaled steady state and an appropriate Gaussian distribution, under regularity conditions for drift and moment conditions for noise. To ensure broad applicability, we cover both i.i.d. and Markovian noise models. We then instantiate these theorems for three representative SA settings: (1) stochastic gradient descent (SGD) for smooth strongly convex objectives, (2) linear SA, and (3) contractive nonlinear SA. We obtain dimension- and stepsize-dependent, explicit bounds in Wasserstein distance of order $\u03b1^{1/2}\\log(1/\u03b1)$ for small $\u03b1$. Building on the Wasserstein approximation error, we further derive non-uniform Berry--Esseen-type tail bounds that compare the steady-state tail probability to Gaussian tails. We achieve an explicit error term that decays in both the deviation level and stepsize $\u03b1$. We adapt the same analysis for SGD beyond strongly convexity and study general convex objectives.

As a result, motions that look plausible as joint trajectories often exhibit body self-penetration and Foot-Ground Contact (FGC) anomalies when visualized with a human body mesh, reducing the aesthetic appeal of generated dances and limiting their real-world applications. We address this skeleton-to-mesh gap by deriving physics-based rewards from the body mesh and applying Reinforcement Learning Fine-Tuning (RLFT) to steer the diffusion model toward physically plausible motion synthesis under mesh visualization. Our reward design combines (i) an imitation reward that measures a motion's general plausibility by its imitability in a physical simulator (penalizing penetration and foot skating), and (ii) a Foot-Ground Deviation (FGD) reward with test-time FGD guidance to better capture the dynamic foot-ground interaction in dance. However, we find that the physics-based rewards tend to push the model to generate freezing motions for fewer physical anomalies and better imitability. To mitigate it, we propose an anti-freezing reward to preserve motion dynamics while maintaining physical plausibility. Experiments on multiple dance datasets consistently demonstrate that our method can significantly improve the physical plausibility of generated motions, yielding more realistic and aesthetically pleasing dances.

For easy tasks, optimal schedules keep increasing batch size throughout. In contrast, for hard tasks, the optimal schedule maintains small batch sizes for most of training and switches to large batches only in a late stage. To explain the emergence of late switching, we uncover a dynamical mechanism -- the fast catch-up effect -- which also manifests in large language model (LLM) pretraining. After switching from small to large batches, the loss rapidly aligns with the constant large-batch trajectory. Using FSL, we show that this effect stems from rapid forgetting of accumulated gradient noise, with the catch-up speed determined by task difficulty.

Recent work hypothesized that behavioral alignment can be drastically improved through \\emph{generative} -- rather than \\emph{discriminative} -- classifiers, with far-reaching implications for models of human vision.\n  Here, we instead show that the increased alignment of generative models can be largely explained by a seemingly innocuous resizing operation in the generative model which effectively acts as a low-pass filter. In a series of controlled experiments, we show that removing high-frequency spatial information from discriminative models like CLIP drastically increases their behavioral alignment. Simply blurring images at test-time -- rather than training on blurred images -- achieves a new state-of-the-art score on the model-vs-human benchmark, halving the current alignment gap between DNNs and human observers. Furthermore, low-pass filters are likely optimal, which we demonstrate by directly optimizing filters for alignment. To contextualize the performance of optimal filters, we compute the frontier of all possible pareto-optimal solutions to the benchmark, which was formerly unknown.\n  We explain our findings by observing that the frequency spectrum of optimal Gaussian filters roughly matches the spectrum of band-pass filters implemented by the human visual system.

Specifically, we observe that the generative process of DiT exhibits substantial sparsity (i.e., some computations can be skipped with minimal impact on quality), and this sparsity varies significantly across samples. Motivated by this observation, E-DiT equips each DiT block with a lightweight router that dynamically identifies sample-dependent sparsity from the input latent. Each router adaptively determines whether the corresponding block can be skipped. If the block is not skipped, the router then predicts the optimal MLP width reduction ratio within the block. During inference, we further introduce a block-level feature caching mechanism that leverages router predictions to eliminate redundant computations in a training-free manner.

However, its theoretical role remains only partially understood. In this work, we propose an information-theoretic framework that systematically accounts for the effect of augmentation on generalization and invariance learning. Our approach builds upon mutual information-based bounds, which relate the generalization gap to the amount of information a learning algorithm retains about its training data. We extend this framework by modeling the augmented distribution as a composition of the original data distribution with a distribution over transformations, which naturally induces an orbit-averaged loss function. Under mild sub-Gaussian assumptions on the loss function and the augmentation process, we derive a new generalization bound that decompose the expected generalization gap into three interpretable terms: (1) a distributional divergence between the original and augmented data, (2) a stability term measuring the algorithm dependence on training data, and (3) a sensitivity term capturing the effect of augmentation variability. To connect our bounds to the geometry of the augmentation group, we introduce the notion of group diameter, defined as the maximal perturbation that augmentations can induce in the input space. The group diameter provides a unified control parameter that bounds all three terms and highlights an intrinsic trade-off: small diameters preserve data fidelity but offer limited regularization, while large diameters enhance stability at the cost of increased bias and sensitivity.

In SSA, each token is represented as an oscillator characterized by a learnable natural frequency and phase; the synchronization strength between token pairs, determined by a frequency-dependent coupling and phase-locking condition, serves as the attention weight.

We identify two key phenomena in modern LLMs: 1) less significant activations may align with highly important weights, and 2) sparsity sensitivity varies non-monotonically across model blocks. We propose Weight-aware Mixed-Granularity Training-free Activation Sparsity (WiSparse), which leverages both activation and weight information for adaptive sparsity allocation. Specifically, we introduce a weight-aware mechanism integrating activation magnitudes with precomputed weight norms to accurately identify salient channels. This is combined with a mixed-granularity allocation scheme: a global budget is distributed across blocks via evolutionary search to protect sensitive regions, then refined within blocks to minimize reconstruction error. We improve sparse kernels and demonstrate effectiveness on three representative models.

Concurrently, the success of multimodal foundation models that integrate vision with complementary modalities suggests that morphomolecular coupling between local expression and morphology can be systematically used to improve histological representations themselves. We introduce Spatial Expression-Aligned Learning (SEAL), a vision-omics self-supervised learning framework that infuses localized molecular information into pathology vision encoders. Rather than training new encoders from scratch, SEAL is designed as a parameter-efficient vision-omics finetuning method that can be flexibly applied to widely used pathology foundation models. We instantiate SEAL by training on over 700,000 paired gene expression spot-tissue region examples spanning tumor and normal samples from 14 organs. Tested across 38 slide-level and 15 patch-level downstream tasks, SEAL provides a drop-in replacement for pathology foundation models that consistently improves performance over widely used vision-only and ST prediction baselines on slide-level molecular status, pathway activity, and treatment response prediction, as well as patch-level gene expression prediction tasks. Additionally, SEAL encoders exhibit robust domain generalization on out-of-distribution evaluations and enable new cross-modal capabilities such as gene-to-image retrieval.

While machine unlearning (MU) provides a technical solution to remove personal data's influence from trained models, ensuring compliance remains challenging due to the fundamental gap between MU's technical feasibility and regulatory implementation. In this paper, we introduce the first economic framework for auditing MU compliance, by integrating certified unlearning theory with regulatory enforcement. We first characterize MU's inherent verification uncertainty using a hypothesis-testing interpretation of certified unlearning to derive the auditor's detection capability, and then propose a game-theoretic model to capture the strategic interactions between the auditor and the operator. A key technical challenge arises from MU-specific nonlinearities inherent in the model utility and the detection probability, which create complex strategic couplings that traditional auditing frameworks do not address and that also preclude closed-form solutions. We address this by transforming the complex bivariate nonlinear fixed-point problem into a tractable univariate auxiliary problem, enabling us to decouple the system and establish the equilibrium existence, uniqueness, and structural properties without relying on explicit solutions. Counterintuitively, our analysis reveals that the auditor can optimally reduce the inspection intensity as deletion requests increase, since the operator's weakened unlearning makes non-compliance easier to detect. This is consistent with recent auditing reductions in China despite growing deletion requests.

It is a trade-off between accuracy, robustness, and the possibility of loop closing. We investigate a third method that combines the strengths of both paradigms into a unified approach.

The International Skin Imaging Collaboration (ISIC) dataset, one of the most widely used benchmarks, contains over 70% light skin images while dark skins fewer than 8%. This imbalance poses a significant barrier to equitable healthcare delivery and highlights the urgent need for methods that address demographic diversity in medical imaging. This paper addresses this challenge of skin tone imbalance in automated skin cancer detection using dermoscopic images. To overcome this, we present a generative augmentation pipeline that fine-tunes a pre-trained Stable Diffusion model using Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) on the image dark-skin subset of the ISIC dataset and generates synthetic dermoscopic images conditioned on lesion type and skin tone. In this study, we investigated the utility of these images on two downstream tasks: lesion segmentation and binary classification. For segmentation, models trained on the augmented dataset and evaluated on held-out real images show consistent improvements in IoU, Dice coefficient, and boundary accuracy. These evalutions provides the verification of Generated dataset. For classification, an EfficientNet-B0 model trained on the augmented dataset achieved 92.14% accuracy.

Existing continuous-time methods reintroduce action information via an advantage-rate function $q$. However, they enforce optimality through complicated martingale losses or orthogonality constraints, which are sensitive to the choice of test processes. These approaches entangle $V$ and $q$ into a large, complex optimization problem that is difficult to train reliably. To address these limitations, we propose a novel decoupled continuous-time actor-critic algorithm with alternating updates: $q$ is learned from diffusion generators on $V$, and $V$ is updated via a Hamiltonian-based value flow that remains informative under infinitesimal time steps, where standard max/softmax backups fail. Theoretically, we prove rigorous convergence via new probabilistic arguments, sidestepping the challenge that generator-based Hamiltonians lack Bellman-style contraction under the sup-norm.

Therefore, there is a strong need to develop systems that can detect joint inflammation easily using RGB images captured at home. Consequently, we tackle the task of RA inflammation detection from RGB hand images.

Recent learning-based methods have demonstrated strong representational capacity for geometric perception and are increasingly used to augment classical geometry-centric systems in practice. However, whether learning components should directly replace geometric estimation or instead serve as intermediate modules within such pipelines remains an open question.\n  In this work, we address this gap and investigate an end-to-end modular framework for effective spatial reasoning, where learning proposes geometric hypotheses, while geometric algorithms dispose estimation decisions. In particular, we study this principle in the context of relative camera pose estimation on RGB-D sequences. Using VGGT as a representative learning model, we evaluate learning-based pose and depth proposals under varying motion magnitudes and scene dynamics, followed by a classical point-to-plane RGB-D ICP as the geometric backend. Our experiments on the TUM RGB-D benchmark reveal three consistent findings: (1) learning-based pose proposals alone are unreliable; (2) learning-proposed geometry, when improperly aligned with camera intrinsics, can degrade performance; and (3) when learning-proposed depth is geometrically aligned and followed by a geometric disposal stage, consistent improvements emerge in moderately challenging rigid settings.\n  These results demonstrate that geometry is not merely a refinement component, but an essential arbiter that validates and absorbs learning-based geometric observations.

As a result, practitioners lack actionable guidance on selecting instructions for their target tasks. In this work, we aim to bring clarity to this landscape by disentangling and systematically analyzing the two core ingredients: data representation and selection algorithms. Our framework enables controlled comparisons across models, tasks, and budgets. We find that only gradient-based data representations choose subsets whose similarity to the query consistently predicts performance across datasets and models. While no single method dominates, gradient-based representations paired with a greedy round-robin selection algorithm tend to perform best on average at low budgets, but these benefits diminish at larger budgets. Finally, we unify several existing selection algorithms as forms of approximate distance minimization between the selected subset and the query set, and support this view with new generalization bounds.

To address this, we propose a Hierarchical Vision-language Interaction for AU Understanding (HiVA) method, which leverages textual AU descriptions as semantic priors to guide and enhance AU detection. Specifically, HiVA employs a large language model to generate diverse and contextually rich AU descriptions to strengthen language-based representation learning. To capture both fine-grained and holistic vision-language associations, HiVA introduces an AU-aware dynamic graph module that facilitates the learning of AU-specific visual representations. These features are further integrated within a hierarchical cross-modal attention architecture comprising two complementary mechanisms: Disentangled Dual Cross-Attention (DDCA), which establishes fine-grained, AU-specific interactions between visual and textual features, and Contextual Dual Cross-Attention (CDCA), which models global inter-AU dependencies. This collaborative, cross-modal learning paradigm enables HiVA to leverage multi-grained vision-based AU features in conjunction with refined language-based AU details, culminating in robust and semantically enriched AU detection capabilities.

Recent work has shown that GD may stably oscillate near a linearly unstable minimum and still converge once the step size decays, indicating that linear analysis can be misleading. In this work, we explicitly study the effect of nonlinear terms. Specifically, we derive an exact criterion for stable oscillations of GD near minima in the multivariate setting. Our condition depends on high-order derivatives, generalizing existing results. Extending the analysis to stochastic gradient descent (SGD), we show that nonlinear dynamics can diverge in expectation even if a single batch is unstable.

These approaches are highly inefficient and sometimes require equal parameters in the adapter compared to the base architecture. It is not always possible to train the model since the diffusion model is itself costly, and doubling the parameter is highly inefficient. In these approaches, the adapter is not aware of the input prompt; therefore, it is optimal only for the structural input but not for the input prompt. To overcome the above challenges, we proposed two efficient adapters, Nexus Prime and Slim, which are guided by prompts and structural inputs. Each Nexus Block incorporates cross-attention mechanisms to enable rich multimodal conditioning. Therefore, the proposed adapter has a better understanding of the input prompt while preserving the structure. We conducted extensive experiments on the proposed models and demonstrated that the Nexus Prime adapter significantly enhances performance, requiring only 8M additional parameters compared to the baseline, T2I-Adapter.

By using the method of characteristics to predict the analytical properties of PDE solutions a priori (even in regions arbitrarily far from the training domain), we show how it is possible to construct rigorous extrapolatory bounds on the worst-case L^inf errors of shallow neural network approximations.

Methods like pruning, quantization, and knowledge distillation have been used to achieve massive reductions in the number of model parameters, with marginal performance drops across a variety of architectures and tasks. This raises the central question: \\emph{Why are deep neural networks suited for compression?} In this work, we take up the perspective of algorithmic complexity to explain this behavior. We hypothesize that the parameters of trained models have more structure and, hence, exhibit lower algorithmic complexity compared to the weights at (random) initialization. Furthermore, that model compression methods harness this reduced algorithmic complexity to compress models. Although an unconstrained parameterization of model weights, $\\mathbf{w} \\in \\mathbb{R}^n$, can represent arbitrary weight assignments, the solutions found during training exhibit repeatability and structure, making them algorithmically simpler than a generic program. To this end, we formalize the Kolmogorov complexity of $\\mathbf{w}$ by $\\mathcal{K}(\\mathbf{w})$. We introduce a constrained parameterization $\\widehat{\\mathbf{w}}$, that partitions parameters into blocks of size $s$, and restricts each block to be selected from a set of $k$ reusable motifs, specified by a reuse pattern (or mosaic). The resulting method, $\\textit{Mosaic-of-Motifs}$ (MoMos), yields algorithmically simpler model parameterization compared to unconstrained models. Empirical evidence from multiple experiments shows that the algorithmic complexity of neural networks, measured using approximations to Kolmogorov complexity, can be reduced during training.

ViTs split images into fixed-size patches, constraining them to a predefined size and necessitating pre-processing steps like resizing, padding, or cropping. This poses challenges in medical imaging, particularly with irregularly shaped structures like tumors. A fixed bounding box crop size produces input images with highly variable foreground-to-background ratios. Resizing medical images can degrade information and introduce artefacts, impacting diagnosis. Hence, tailoring variable-sized crops to regions of interest can enhance feature representation capabilities. Moreover, large images are computationally expensive, and smaller sizes risk information loss, presenting a computation-accuracy tradeoff. We propose VariViT, an improved ViT model crafted to handle variable image sizes while maintaining a consistent patch size. VariViT employs a novel positional embedding resizing scheme for a variable number of patches. We also implement a new batching strategy within VariViT to reduce computational complexity, resulting in faster training and inference times. In our evaluations on two 3D brain MRI datasets, VariViT surpasses vanilla ViTs and ResNet in glioma genotype prediction and brain tumor classification. It achieves F1-scores of 75.5% and 76.3%, respectively, learning more discriminative features. Our proposed batching strategy reduces computation time by up to 30% compared to conventional architectures. These findings underscore the efficacy of VariViT in image representation learning.

Previous literature has largely focused on edge maps, often misnamed 'sketches', yet algorithms that effectively handle true freehand sketches, with their inherent abstraction and distortions, remain underexplored. We pursue the challenging goal of balancing photorealism with sketch adherence when generating images from freehand input. A key obstacle is the absence of ground-truth, pixel-aligned images: by their nature, freehand sketches do not have a single correct alignment. To address this, we propose a modulation-based approach that prioritizes semantic interpretation of the sketch over strict adherence to individual edge positions.

To overcome this limitation, we introduce BHyGNN+, a self-supervised learning framework that extends BHyGNN for representation learning on heterophilic hypergraphs without requiring ground-truth labels. The core idea of BHyGNN+ is hypergraph duality, a structural transformation where the roles of nodes and hyperedges are interchanged. By contrasting augmented views of a hypergraph against its dual using cosine similarity, our framework captures essential structural patterns in a fully unsupervised manner. Notably, this duality-based formulation eliminates the need for negative samples, a common requirement in existing hypergraph contrastive learning methods that is often difficult to satisfy in practice. Extensive experiments on eleven benchmark datasets demonstrate that BHyGNN+ consistently outperforms state-of-the-art supervised and self-supervised baselines on both heterophilic and homophilic hypergraphs.

Yet, most existing approaches rely on image-specific adversarial perturbations that require individual optimization for each image, thereby limiting scalability and practicality. In this paper, we propose the first universal image immunization framework that generates a single, broadly applicable adversarial perturbation specifically designed for diffusion-based editing pipelines. Inspired by universal adversarial perturbation (UAP) techniques used in targeted attacks, our method generates a UAP that embeds a semantic target into images to be protected. Simultaneously, it suppresses original content to effectively misdirect the model's attention during editing. As a result, our approach effectively blocks malicious editing attempts by overwriting the original semantic content in the image via the UAP. Moreover, our method operates effectively even in data-free settings without requiring access to training data or domain knowledge, further enhancing its practicality and broad applicability in real-world scenarios. Extensive experiments show that our method, as the first universal immunization approach, significantly outperforms several baselines in the UAP setting.

Recent extensions broaden this perspective, yet they either fail to explicitly model synergistic interactions or learn different information components in an entangled manner, leading to incomplete representations and potential information leakage. We introduce \\textbf{COrAL}, a principled framework that explicitly and simultaneously preserves redundant, unique, and synergistic information within multimodal representations. COrAL employs a dual-path architecture with orthogonality constraints to disentangle shared and modality-specific features, ensuring a clean separation of information components.

In contrast, recent generic object trackers are often optimized for training targets, which limits robustness and generalization in unseen scenarios, and their occlusion reasoning remains coarse, lacking detailed modeling of occlusion patterns. To address these limitations in generalization and occlusion perception, we propose GOT-JEPA, a model-predictive pretraining framework that extends JEPA from predicting image features to predicting tracking models. Given identical historical information, a teacher predictor generates pseudo-tracking models from a clean current frame, and a student predictor learns to predict the same pseudo-tracking models from a corrupted version of the current frame. This design provides stable pseudo supervision and explicitly trains the predictor to produce reliable tracking models under occlusions, distractors, and other adverse observations, improving generalization to dynamic environments. Building on GOT-JEPA, we further propose OccuSolver to enhance occlusion perception for object tracking. OccuSolver adapts a point-centric point tracker for object-aware visibility estimation and detailed occlusion-pattern capture. Conditioned on object priors iteratively generated by the tracker, OccuSolver incrementally refines visibility states, strengthens occlusion handling, and produces higher-quality reference labels that progressively improve subsequent model predictions.

Unlike previous attacks that rely on white/grey-box assumptions (such as classifier scores or gradients) or libraries of existing jailbreaks, BPJ is fully black-box and uses only a single bit of information per query: whether or not the classifier flags the interaction. To achieve this, BPJ addresses the core difficulty in optimising attacks against robust real-world defences: evaluating whether a proposed modification to an attack is an improvement. Instead of directly trying to learn an attack for a target harmful string, BPJ converts the string into a curriculum of intermediate attack targets and then actively selects evaluation points that best detect small changes in attack strength (\"boundary points\"). We believe BPJ is the first fully automated attack algorithm that succeeds in developing universal jailbreaks against Constitutional Classifiers, as well as the first automated attack algorithm that succeeds against GPT-5's input classifier without relying on human attack seeds.

Using Gaze-CIFAR-10, we show that a trivial center-fixation baseline achieves surprisingly strong scanpath scores, approaching many learned policies. This makes standard metrics optimistic and blurs the distinction between genuine behavioral alignment and mere central tendency. We then analyze a hard-attention classifier under constrained vision by sweeping foveal patch size and peripheral context, revealing a peripheral sweet spot: only a narrow range of sensory constraints yields scanpaths that are simultaneously (i) above the center baseline after debiasing and (ii) temporally human-like in movement statistics. To address center bias, we propose GCS (Gaze Consistency Score), a center-debiased composite metric augmented with movement similarity. GCS uncovers a robust sweet spot at medium patch size with both foveal and peripheral vision, that is not obvious from raw scanpath metrics or accuracy alone, and also highlights a \"shortcut regime\" when the field-of-view becomes too large.

Building on a formal quotient-space perspective, our work provides a comprehensive theory of canonical diffusion by proving: (i) the correctness, universality and superior expressivity of canonical generative models over invariant targets; (ii) canonicalization accelerates training by removing diffusion score complexity induced by group mixtures and reducing conditional variance in flow matching. We then show that aligned priors and optimal transport act complementarily with canonicalization and further improves training efficiency. We instantiate the framework for molecular graph generation under $S_n \\times SE(3)$ symmetries.
