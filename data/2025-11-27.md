Abstract: In the age of agentic AI, the growing deployment of multi-modal models (MMs) has introduced new attack vectors that can leak sensitive training data in MMs, causing privacy leakage. This paper investigates a black-box privacy attack, i.e., membership inference attack (MIA) on multi-modal vision-language models (VLMs). State-of-the-art research analyzes privacy attacks primarily to unimodal AI-ML systems, while recent studies indicate MMs can also be vulnerable to privacy attacks. While researchers have demonstrated that biologically inspired neural network representations can improve unimodal model resilience against adversarial attacks, it remains unexplored whether neuro-inspired MMs are resilient against privacy attacks. In this work, we introduce a systematic neuroscience-inspired topological regularization (tau) framework to analyze MM VLMs resilience against image-text-based inference privacy attacks. We examine this phenomenon using three VLMs: BLIP, PaliGemma 2, and ViT-GPT2, across three benchmark datasets: COCO, CC3M, and NoCaps. Our experiments compare the resilience of baseline and neuro VLMs (with topological regularization), where the tau > 0 configuration defines the NEURO variant of VLM. Our results on the BLIP model using the COCO dataset illustrate that MIA attack success in NEURO VLMs drops by 24% mean ROC-AUC, while achieving similar model utility (similarities between generated and reference captions) in terms of MPNet and ROUGE-2 metrics. This shows neuro VLMs are comparatively more resilient against privacy attacks, while not significantly compromising model utility. Our extensive evaluation with PaliGemma 2 and ViT-GPT2 models, on two additional datasets: CC3M and NoCaps, further validates the consistency of the findings. This work contributes to the growing understanding of privacy risks in MMs and provides evidence on neuro VLMs privacy threat resilience.

Abstract: World models serve as core simulators for fields such as agentic AI, embodied AI, and gaming, capable of generating long, physically realistic, and interactive high-quality videos. Moreover, scaling these models could unlock emergent capabilities in visual perception, understanding, and reasoning, paving the way for a new paradigm that moves beyond current LLM-centric vision foundation models. A key breakthrough empowering them is the semi-autoregressive (block-diffusion) decoding paradigm, which merges the strengths of diffusion and autoregressive methods by generating video tokens in block-applying diffusion within each block while conditioning on previous ones, resulting in more coherent and stable video sequences. Crucially, it overcomes limitations of standard video diffusion by reintroducing LLM-style KV Cache management, enabling efficient, variable-length, and high-quality generation.
  Therefore, Inferix is specifically designed as a next-generation inference engine to enable immersive world synthesis through optimized semi-autoregressive decoding processes. This dedicated focus on world simulation distinctly sets it apart from systems engineered for high-concurrency scenarios (like vLLM or SGLang) and from classic video diffusion models (such as xDiTs). Inferix further enhances its offering with interactive video streaming and profiling, enabling real-time interaction and realistic simulation to accurately model world dynamics. Additionally, it supports efficient benchmarking through seamless integration of LV-Bench, a new fine-grained evaluation benchmark tailored for minute-long video generation scenarios. We hope the community will work together to advance Inferix and foster world model exploration.

Abstract: Fast and accurate video object recognition, which relies on frame-by-frame video analytics, remains a challenge for resource-constrained devices such as traffic cameras. Recent advances in mobile edge computing have made it possible to offload computation-intensive object detection to edge servers equipped with high-accuracy neural networks, while lightweight and fast object tracking algorithms run locally on devices. This hybrid approach offers a promising solution but introduces a new challenge: deciding when to perform edge detection versus local tracking. To address this, we formulate two long-term optimization problems for both single-device and multi-device scenarios, taking into account the temporal correlation of consecutive frames and the dynamic conditions of mobile edge networks. Based on the formulation, we propose the LTED-Ada in single-device setting, a deep reinforcement learning-based algorithm that adaptively selects between local tracking and edge detection, according to the frame rate as well as recognition accuracy and delay requirement. In multi-device setting, we further enhance LTED-Ada using federated learning to enable collaborative policy training across devices, thereby improving its generalization to unseen frame rates and performance requirements. Finally, we conduct extensive hardware-in-the-loop experiments using multiple Raspberry Pi 4B devices and a personal computer as the edge server, demonstrating the superiority of LTED-Ada.

Abstract: Vision-Language Action (VLA) models unify perception, reasoning, and trajectory generation for autonomous driving, but suffer from significant inference latency due to deep transformer stacks. We present DeeAD, a training-free, action-guided early-exit framework that accelerates VLA planning by evaluating the physical feasibility of intermediate trajectories. Instead of relying on confidence scores, DeeAD terminates inference when predicted trajectories align with lightweight planning priors (e.g., Navigation or Low-precision Planning) within a tolerable deviation (<2m). To improve efficiency, we introduce a multi-hop controller that adaptively skips redundant layers based on the change rate of scores. DeeAD integrates into existing VLA models, such as ORION, without requiring retraining. Experiments on the Bench2Drive benchmark demonstrate up to 28% transformer-layer sparsity and 29% latency reduction, while preserving planning quality and safety.

Abstract: Foundation models pre-trained with self-supervised learning (SSL) on large-scale datasets have become powerful general-purpose feature extractors. However, their immense size and computational cost make them prohibitive for deployment on edge devices such as robots and AR/VR headsets. Existing compression techniques like standard knowledge distillation create efficient 'specialist' models but sacrifice the crucial, downstream-agnostic generality that makes foundation models so valuable.  In this paper, we introduce Foundation Model Distillation (FMD), a new paradigm for compressing large SSL models into compact, efficient, and faithful proxies that retain their general-purpose representational power. We present Foundry, the first implementation of FMD for 3D point clouds. Our approach, Foundry, trains a student to learn a compressed set of SuperTokens that reconstruct the teacher's token-level representations, capturing a compact basis of its latent space. A single distilled model maintains strong transferability across diverse downstream tasks-classification, part segmentation, and few-shot scenarios-approaching full foundation-model performance while using significantly fewer tokens and FLOPs, making such models more practical for deployment on resourceconstrained hardware.

Abstract: We introduce DinoLizer, a DINOv2-based model for localizing manipulated regions in generative inpainting. Our method builds on a DINOv2 model pretrained to detect synthetic images on the B-Free dataset. We add a linear classification head on top of the Vision Transformer's patch embeddings to predict manipulations at a $14\times 14$ patch resolution. The head is trained to focus on semantically altered regions, treating non-semantic edits as part of the original content. Because the ViT accepts only fixed-size inputs, we use a sliding-window strategy to aggregate predictions over larger images; the resulting heatmaps are post-processed to refine the estimated binary manipulation masks. Empirical results show that DinoLizer surpasses state-of-the-art local manipulation detectors on a range of inpainting datasets derived from different generative models. It remains robust to common post-processing operations such as resizing, noise addition, and JPEG (double) compression. On average, DinoLizer achieves a 12\% higher Intersection-over-Union (IoU) than the next best model, with even greater gains after post-processing. Our experiments with off-the-shelf DINOv2 demonstrate the strong representational power of Vision Transformers for this task. Finally, extensive ablation studies comparing DINOv2 and its successor, DINOv3, in deepfake localization confirm DinoLizer's superiority. The code will be publicly available upon acceptance of the paper.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: User interface (UI) design is an iterative process in which designers progressively refine their work with design software such as Figma or Sketch. Recent advances in vision language models (VLMs) with tool invocation suggest these models can operate design software to edit a UI design through iteration. Understanding and enhancing this capacity is important, as it highlights VLMs' potential to collaborate with designers within conventional software. However, as no existing benchmark evaluates tool-based design performance, the capacity remains unknown. To address this, we introduce CANVAS, a benchmark for VLMs on tool-based user interface design. Our benchmark contains 598 tool-based design tasks paired with ground-truth references sampled from 3.3K mobile UI designs across 30 function-based categories (e.g., onboarding, messaging). In each task, a VLM updates the design step-by-step through context-based tool invocations (e.g., create a rectangle as a button background), linked to design software. Specifically, CANVAS incorporates two task types: (i) design replication evaluates the ability to reproduce a whole UI screen; (ii) design modification evaluates the ability to modify a specific part of an existing screen. Results suggest that leading models exhibit more strategic tool invocations, improving design quality. Furthermore, we identify common error patterns models exhibit, guiding future work in enhancing tool-based design capabilities.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Image encoders, a fundamental component of vision-language models (VLMs), are typically pretrained independently before being aligned with a language model. This standard paradigm results in encoders that process images agnostically, without regard to the specific downstream task or text query. To address this limitation, we propose the Text-Guided Semantic Image Encoder (TIE), which generates image representations conditioned on the input text query. VLMs equipped with TIE outperform their conventional counterparts by +1.5 and +1.3 points on average across nine image-to-text benchmarks at the 1B and 3B scales, respectively, with gains reaching up to 6 points on tasks such as DocVQA and InfoVQA. Moreover, TIE-based VLMs attain superior performance while utilizing only half as many image tiles (tokens), resulting in notably improved inference efficiency. TIE also generalizes well with generic queries, indicating that text-conditioned training effectively optimizes the encoder to capture key visual features. Qualitative analysis confirms that TIE consistently attends to query-relevant regions, enhancing both interpretability and query-specific grounding.

Abstract: Large multimodal models (LMMs) have shown great potential for video reasoning with textual Chain-of-Thought. However, they remain vulnerable to hallucinations, especially when processing long-form videos where evidence is sparse and temporally dispersed. Inspired by how humans comprehend long videos - by first skimming globally and then examining relevant clips for details - we introduce LongVT, an end-to-end agentic framework that enables "Thinking with Long Videos" via interleaved Multimodal Chain-of-Tool-Thought. Specifically, we exploit LMMs' inherent temporal grounding ability as a native video cropping tool to zoom in on a specific video clip and resample finer-grained video frames. This global-to-local reasoning loop continues until answers are grounded in retrieved visual evidence. Given the scarcity of fine-grained question-answering (QA) data for the long video reasoning task, we curate and will release a data suite named VideoSIAH to facilitate both training and evaluation. Specifically, our training dataset consists of 247.9K samples for tool-integrated cold-start supervised fine-tuning, 1.6K samples for agentic reinforcement learning, and 15.4K samples for agentic reinforcement fine-tuning, respectively. Our evaluation benchmark consists of 1,280 QA pairs that are carefully curated through a semi-automatic data pipeline with human-in-the-loop validation. With a meticulously designed three-stage training strategy and extensive empirical validation, LongVT consistently outperforms existing strong baselines across four challenging long-video understanding and reasoning benchmarks. Our codes, data, and model checkpoints are publicly available at https://github.com/EvolvingLMMs-Lab/LongVT .

Abstract: Facebook AI Research introduced KRISP [4], which integrates structured external knowledge into pipelines for vision-language reasoning. Despite its effectiveness, the original model has been developed for industrial-scale training, is computationally demanding, and is tightly connected to a large backbone. In this work, we reexamine KRISP from a different angle and offer a lightweight reproduction with significantly fewer parameters. Even though our replicated model performs about 75 % of the original, the replication process uncovers a number of design flaws, real-world pitfalls, and implicit problems that were not fully covered in the original paper. We offer insights into the scalability and efficacy of knowledge-enhanced VQA architectures under resource constraints through systematic ablation studies, which include a proof-of-concept on synthetic VQA data and evaluation on the DAQUAR dataset. Our model, configured with a low parameter setup and constrained by the external Knowledge graph domain, prevents AI hallucinations and generates outputs solely within that domain. Minimal parameters allow us to function on edge devices like smartphones and AR-VR, further improving offline visual reasoning.

Abstract: Dynamic sampling mechanisms in deep learning architectures have demonstrated utility across many computer vision models, though the theoretical analysis of these structures has not yet been unified. In this paper we connect the various dynamic sampling methods by developing and analyzing a novel operator which generalizes existing methods, which we term "warping". Warping provides a minimal implementation of dynamic sampling which is amenable to analysis, and can be used to reconstruct existing architectures including deformable convolutions, active convolutional units, and spatial transformer networks. Using our formalism, we provide statistical analysis of the operator by modeling the inputs as both IID variables and homogeneous random fields. Extending this analysis, we discover a unique asymmetry between the forward and backward pass of the model training. We demonstrate that these mechanisms represent an entirely different class of orthogonal operators to the traditional translationally invariant operators defined by convolutions. With a combination of theoretical analysis and empirical investigation, we find the conditions necessary to ensure stable training of dynamic sampling networks. In addition, statistical analysis of discretization effects are studied. Finally, we introduce a novel loss landscape visualization which utilizes gradient update information directly, to better understand learning behavior.

Abstract: Neural Radiance Fields (NeRFs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in 3D reconstruction and novel view synthesis. However, most existing NeRF frameworks require complete retraining when new views are introduced incrementally, limiting their applicability in domains where data arrives sequentially. This limitation is particularly problematic in satellite-based terrain analysis, where regions are repeatedly observed over time. Incremental refinement of NeRFs remains underexplored, and naive approaches suffer from catastrophic forgetting when past data is unavailable. We propose $Δ$-NeRF, a unique modular residual framework for incremental NeRF refinement. $Δ$-NeRF introduces several novel techniques including: (1) a residual controller that injects per-layer corrections into a frozen base NeRF, enabling refinement without access to past data; (2) an uncertainty-aware gating mechanism that prevents overcorrection by adaptively combining base and refined predictions; and (3) a view selection strategy that reduces training data by up to 47\% while maintaining performance. Additionally, we employ knowledge distillation to compress the enhanced model into a compact student network (20\% of original size). Experiments on satellite imagery demonstrate that $Δ$-NeRF achieves performance comparable to joint training while reducing training time by 30-42\%. $Δ$-NeRF consistently outperforms existing baselines, achieving an improvement of up to 43.5\% in PSNR over naive fine-tuning and surpassing joint training on some metrics.

Abstract: We present Split-then-Merge (StM), a novel framework designed to enhance control in generative video composition and address its data scarcity problem. Unlike conventional methods relying on annotated datasets or handcrafted rules, StM splits a large corpus of unlabeled videos into dynamic foreground and background layers, then self-composes them to learn how dynamic subjects interact with diverse scenes. This process enables the model to learn the complex compositional dynamics required for realistic video generation. StM introduces a novel transformation-aware training pipeline that utilizes a multi-layer fusion and augmentation to achieve affordance-aware composition, alongside an identity-preservation loss that maintains foreground fidelity during blending. Experiments show StM outperforms SoTA methods in both quantitative benchmarks and in humans/VLLM-based qualitative evaluations.

Abstract: We present Sphinx, a synthetic environment for visual perception and reasoning that targets core cognitive primitives. Sphinx procedurally generates puzzles using motifs, tiles, charts, icons, and geometric primitives, each paired with verifiable ground-truth solutions, enabling both precise evaluation and large-scale dataset construction. The benchmark covers 25 task types spanning symmetry detection, geometric transformations, spatial reasoning, chart interpretation, and sequence prediction. Evaluating recent large vision-language models (LVLMs) shows that even state-of-the-art GPT-5 attains only 51.1% accuracy, well below human performance. Finally, we demonstrate that reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) substantially improves model accuracy on these tasks and yields gains on external visual reasoning benchmarks, highlighting its promise for advancing multimodal reasoning.

Abstract: Diffusion models have established the state-of-the-art in text-to-image generation, but their performance often relies on a diffusion prior network to translate text embeddings into the visual manifold for easier decoding. These priors are computationally expensive and require extensive training on massive datasets. In this work, we challenge the necessity of a trained prior at all by employing Optimization-based Visual Inversion (OVI), a training-free and data-free alternative, to replace the need for a prior. OVI initializes a latent visual representation from random pseudo-tokens and iteratively optimizes it to maximize the cosine similarity with input textual prompt embedding. We further propose two novel constraints, a Mahalanobis-based and a Nearest-Neighbor loss, to regularize the OVI optimization process toward the distribution of realistic images. Our experiments, conducted on Kandinsky 2.2, show that OVI can serve as an alternative to traditional priors. More importantly, our analysis reveals a critical flaw in current evaluation benchmarks like T2I-CompBench++, where simply using the text embedding as a prior achieves surprisingly high scores, despite lower perceptual quality. Our constrained OVI methods improve visual fidelity over this baseline, with the Nearest-Neighbor approach proving particularly effective, achieving quantitative scores comparable to or higher than the state-of-the-art data-efficient prior, indicating that the idea merits further investigation. The code will be publicly available upon acceptance.

Abstract: Tubular trees, such as blood vessels and lung airways, are essential for material transport within the human body. Accurately detecting their centerlines with correct tree topology is critical for clinical tasks such as diagnosis, treatment planning, and surgical navigation. In these applications, maintaining high recall is crucial, as missing small branches can result in fatal mistakes caused by incomplete assessments or undetected abnormalities. We present RefTr, a 3D image-to-graph model for centerline generation of vascular trees via recurrent refinement of confluent trajectories. RefTr uses a Producer-Refiner architecture based on a Transformer decoder, where the Producer proposes a set of initial confluent trajectories that are recurrently refined by the Refiner to produce final trajectories, which forms the centerline graph. The confluent trajectory representation enables refinement of complete trajectories while explicitly enforcing a valid tree topology. The recurrent refinement scheme improves precision and reuses the same Refiner block across multiple steps, yielding a 2.4x reduction in decoder parameters compared to previous SOTA. We also introduce an efficient non-maximum suppression algorithm for spatial tree graphs to merge duplicate branches and boost precision. Across multiple public centerline datasets, RefTr achieves superior recall and comparable precision to previous SOTA, while offering faster inference and substantially fewer parameters, demonstrating its potential as a new state-of-the-art framework for vascular tree analysis in 3D medical imaging.

Abstract: Reliable depth estimation under real optical conditions remains a core challenge for camera vision in systems such as autonomous robotics and augmented reality. Despite recent progress in depth estimation and depth-of-field rendering, research remains constrained by the lack of large-scale, high-fidelity, real stereo DSLR datasets, limiting real-world generalization and evaluation of models trained on synthetic data as shown extensively in literature. We present the first high-resolution (5472$\times$3648px) stereo DSLR dataset with 18000 images, systematically varying focal length and aperture across complex real scenes and capturing the optical realism and complexity of professional camera systems. For 9 scenes with varying scene complexity, lighting and background, images are captured with two identical camera assemblies at 10 focal lengths (28-70mm) and 5 apertures (f/2.8-f/22), spanning 50 optical configurations in 2000 images per scene. This full-range optics coverage enables controlled analysis of geometric and optical effects for monocular and stereo depth estimation, shallow depth-of-field rendering, deblurring, 3D scene reconstruction and novel view synthesis. Each focal configuration has a dedicated calibration image set, supporting evaluation of classical and learning based methods for intrinsic and extrinsic calibration. The dataset features challenging visual elements such as multi-scale optical illusions, reflective surfaces, mirrors, transparent glass walls, fine-grained details, and natural / artificial ambient light variations. This work attempts to bridge the realism gap between synthetic training data and real camera optics, and demonstrates challenges with the current state-of-the-art monocular, stereo depth and depth-of-field methods. We release the dataset, calibration files, and evaluation code to support reproducible research on real-world optical generalization.

Abstract: Visual content memorability has intrigued the scientific community for decades, with applications ranging widely, from understanding nuanced aspects of human memory to enhancing content design. A significant challenge in progressing the field lies in the expensive process of collecting memorability annotations from humans. This limits the diversity and scalability of datasets for modeling visual content memorability. Most existing datasets are limited to collecting aggregate memorability scores for visual content, not capturing the nuanced memorability signals present in natural, open-ended recall descriptions. In this work, we introduce the first large-scale unsupervised dataset designed explicitly for modeling visual memorability signals, containing over 82,000 videos, accompanied by descriptive recall data. We leverage tip-of-the-tongue (ToT) retrieval queries from online platforms such as Reddit. We demonstrate that our unsupervised dataset provides rich signals for two memorability-related tasks: recall generation and ToT retrieval. Large vision-language models fine-tuned on our dataset outperform state-of-the-art models such as GPT-4o in generating open-ended memorability descriptions for visual content. We also employ a contrastive training strategy to create the first model capable of performing multimodal ToT retrieval. Our dataset and models present a novel direction, facilitating progress in visual content memorability research.

Abstract: We propose a method which, given a sequence of stereo foggy images, estimates the parameters of a fog model and updates them dynamically. In contrast with previous approaches, which estimate the parameters sequentially and thus are prone to error propagation, our algorithm estimates all the parameters simultaneously by solving a novel optimisation problem. By assuming that fog is only locally homogeneous, our method effectively handles real-world fog, which is often globally inhomogeneous. The proposed algorithm can be easily used as an add-on module in existing visual Simultaneous Localisation and Mapping (SLAM) or odometry systems in the presence of fog. In order to assess our method, we also created a new dataset, the Stereo Driving In Real Fog (SDIRF), consisting of high-quality, consecutive stereo frames of real, foggy road scenes under a variety of visibility conditions, totalling over 40 minutes and 34k frames. As a first-of-its-kind, SDIRF contains the camera's photometric parameters calibrated in a lab environment, which is a prerequisite for correctly applying the atmospheric scattering model to foggy images. The dataset also includes the counterpart clear data of the same routes recorded in overcast weather, which is useful for companion work in image defogging and depth reconstruction. We conducted extensive experiments using both synthetic foggy data and real foggy sequences from SDIRF to demonstrate the superiority of the proposed algorithm over prior methods. Our method not only produces the most accurate estimates on synthetic data, but also adapts better to real fog.

Abstract: Cross-view object correspondence, exemplified by the representative task of ego-exo object correspondence, aims to establish consistent associations of the same object across different viewpoints (e.g., ego-centric and exo-centric). This task poses significant challenges due to drastic viewpoint and appearance variations, making existing segmentation models, such as SAM2, non-trivial to apply directly. To address this, we present V^2-SAM, a unified cross-view object correspondence framework that adapts SAM2 from single-view segmentation to cross-view correspondence through two complementary prompt generators. Specifically, the Cross-View Anchor Prompt Generator (V^2-Anchor), built upon DINOv3 features, establishes geometry-aware correspondences and, for the first time, unlocks coordinate-based prompting for SAM2 in cross-view scenarios, while the Cross-View Visual Prompt Generator (V^2-Visual) enhances appearance-guided cues via a novel visual prompt matcher that aligns ego-exo representations from both feature and structural perspectives. To effectively exploit the strengths of both prompts, we further adopt a multi-expert design and introduce a Post-hoc Cyclic Consistency Selector (PCCS) that adaptively selects the most reliable expert based on cyclic consistency. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of V^2-SAM, achieving new state-of-the-art performance on Ego-Exo4D (ego-exo object correspondence), DAVIS-2017 (video object tracking), and HANDAL-X (robotic-ready cross-view correspondence).

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Test-time alignment (TTA) aims to adapt models to specific rewards during inference. However, existing methods tend to either under-optimise or over-optimise (reward hack) the target reward function. We propose Null-Text Test-Time Alignment (Null-TTA), which aligns diffusion models by optimising the unconditional embedding in classifier-free guidance, rather than manipulating latent or noise variables. Due to the structured semantic nature of the text embedding space, this ensures alignment occurs on a semantically coherent manifold and prevents reward hacking (exploiting non-semantic noise patterns to improve the reward). Since the unconditional embedding in classifier-free guidance serves as the anchor for the model's generative distribution, Null-TTA directly steers model's generative distribution towards the target reward rather than just adjusting the samples, even without updating model parameters. Thanks to these desirable properties, we show that Null-TTA achieves state-of-the-art target test-time alignment while maintaining strong cross-reward generalisation. This establishes semantic-space optimisation as an effective and principled novel paradigm for TTA.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Implicit Neural Representations (INRs) have become an essential tool for modeling continuous 2D images, enabling high-fidelity reconstruction, super-resolution, and compression. Popular architectures such as SIREN, WIRE, and FINER demonstrate the potential of INR for capturing fine-grained image details. However, traditional INRs often lack explicit geometric structure and have limited capabilities for local editing or integration with physical simulation, restricting their applicability in dynamic or interactive settings. To address these limitations, we propose GaINeR: Geometry-Aware Implicit Network Representation, a novel framework for 2D images that combines trainable Gaussian distributions with a neural network-based INR. For a given image coordinate, the model retrieves the K nearest Gaussians, aggregates distance-weighted embeddings, and predicts the RGB value via a neural network. This design enables continuous image representation, interpretable geometric structure, and flexible local editing, providing a foundation for physically aware and interactive image manipulation. The official implementation of our method is publicly available at https://github.com/WJakubowska/GaINeR.

Abstract: Objectives: To evaluate a deep learning (DL) model for reducing the agent dose of contrast-enhanced T1-weighted MRI (T1ce) of the cerebellopontine angle (CPA) cistern. Materials and methods: In this multi-center retrospective study, T1 and T1ce of vestibular schwannoma (VS) patients were used to simulate low-dose T1ce with varying reductions of contrast agent dose. DL models were trained to restore standard-dose T1ce from the low-dose simulation. The image quality and segmentation performance of the DL-restored T1ce were evaluated. A head and neck radiologist was asked to rate DL-restored images in multiple aspects, including image quality and diagnostic characterization. Results: 203 MRI studies from 72 VS patients (mean age, 58.51 \pm 14.73, 39 men) were evaluated. As the input dose increased, the structural similarity index measure of the restored T1ce increased from 0.639 \pm 0.113 to 0.993 \pm 0.009, and the peak signal-to-noise ratio increased from 21.6 \pm 3.73 dB to 41.4 \pm 4.84 dB. At 10% input dose, using DL-restored T1ce for segmentation improved the Dice from 0.673 to 0.734, the 95% Hausdorff distance from 2.38 mm to 2.07 mm, and the average surface distance from 1.00 mm to 0.59 mm. Both DL-restored T1ce from 10% and 30% input doses showed excellent images, with the latter being considered more informative. Conclusion: The DL model improved the image quality of low-dose MRI of the CPA cistern, which makes lesion detection and diagnostic characterization possible with 10% - 30% of the standard dose.

Abstract: We propose a smooth regularization technique that instills a strong temporal inductive bias in video recognition models, particularly benefiting lightweight architectures. Our method encourages smoothness in the intermediate-layer embeddings of consecutive frames by modeling their changes as a Gaussian Random Walk (GRW). This penalizes abrupt representational shifts, thereby promoting low-acceleration solutions that better align with the natural temporal coherence inherent in videos. By leveraging this enforced smoothness, lightweight models can more effectively capture complex temporal dynamics. Applied to such models, our technique yields a 3.8% to 6.4% accuracy improvement on Kinetics-600. Notably, the MoViNets model family trained with our smooth regularization improves the current state of the art by 3.8% to 6.1% within their respective FLOP constraints, while MobileNetV3 and the MoViNets-Stream family achieve gains of 4.9% to 6.4% over prior state-of-the-art models with comparable memory footprints.

Abstract: Neurons are the fundamental building blocks of deep neural networks, and their interconnections allow AI to achieve unprecedented results. Motivated by the goal of understanding how neurons encode information, compositional explanations leverage logical relationships between concepts to express the spatial alignment between neuron activations and human knowledge. However, these explanations rely on human-annotated datasets, restricting their applicability to specific domains and predefined concepts. This paper addresses this limitation by introducing a framework for the vision domain that allows users to probe neurons for arbitrary concepts and datasets. Specifically, the framework leverages masks generated by open vocabulary semantic segmentation to compute open vocabulary compositional explanations. The proposed framework consists of three steps: specifying arbitrary concepts, generating semantic segmentation masks using open vocabulary models, and deriving compositional explanations from these masks. The paper compares the proposed framework with previous methods for computing compositional explanations both in terms of quantitative metrics and human interpretability, analyzes the differences in explanations when shifting from human-annotated data to model-annotated data, and showcases the additional capabilities provided by the framework in terms of flexibility of the explanations with respect to the tasks and properties of interest.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Tree-ring growth represents the annual wood increment for a tree, and quantifying it allows researchers to assess which silvicultural practices are best suited for each species. Manual measurement of this growth is time-consuming and often imprecise, as it is typically performed along 4 to 8 radial directions on a cross-sectional disc. In recent years, automated algorithms and datasets have emerged to enhance accuracy and automate the delineation of annual rings in cross-sectional images.
  To address the scarcity of wood cross-section data, we introduce the UruDendro4 dataset, a collection of 102 image samples of Pinus taeda L., each manually annotated with annual growth rings. Unlike existing public datasets, UruDendro4 includes samples extracted at multiple heights along the stem, allowing for the volumetric modeling of annual growth using manually delineated rings. This dataset (images and annotations) allows the development of volumetric models for annual wood estimation based on cross-sectional imagery.
  Additionally, we provide a performance baseline for automatic ring detection on this dataset using state-of-the-art methods. The highest performance was achieved by the DeepCS-TRD method, with a mean Average Precision of 0.838, a mean Average Recall of 0.782, and an Adapted Rand Error score of 0.084. A series of ablation experiments were conducted to empirically validate the final parameter configuration. Furthermore, we empirically demonstrate that training a learning model including this dataset improves the model's generalization in the tree-ring detection task.

Abstract: Automated radiology report generation (RRG) for breast ultrasound (BUS) is limited by the lack of paired image-report datasets and the risk of hallucinations from large language models. We propose BUSTR, a multitask vision-language framework that generates BUS reports without requiring paired image-report supervision. BUSTR constructs reports from structured descriptors (e.g., BI-RADS, pathology, histology) and radiomics features, learns descriptor-aware visual representations with a multi-head Swin encoder trained using a multitask loss over dataset-specific descriptor sets, and aligns visual and textual tokens via a dual-level objective that combines token-level cross-entropy with a cosine-similarity alignment loss between input and output representations. We evaluate BUSTR on two public BUS datasets, BrEaST and BUS-BRA, which differ in size and available descriptors. Across both datasets, BUSTR consistently improves standard natural language generation metrics and clinical efficacy metrics, particularly for key targets such as BI-RADS category and pathology. Our results show that this descriptor-aware vision model, trained with a combined token-level and alignment loss, improves both automatic report metrics and clinical efficacy without requiring paired image-report data.

Abstract: As a widely used operation in image editing workflows, image composition has traditionally been studied with a focus on achieving visual realism and semantic plausibility. However, in practical editing scenarios of the modern content creation landscape, many compositions are not intended to preserve realism. Instead, users of online platforms motivated by gaining community recognition often aim to create content that is more artistic, playful, or socially engaging. Taking inspiration from this observation, we define the expressive composition task, a new formulation of image composition that embraces stylistic diversity and looser placement logic, reflecting how users edit images on real-world creative platforms. To address this underexplored problem, we present StickerNet, a two-stage framework that first determines the composition type, then predicts placement parameters such as opacity, mask, location, and scale accordingly. Unlike prior work that constructs datasets by simulating object placements on real images, we directly build our dataset from 1.8 million editing actions collected on an anonymous online visual creation and editing platform, each reflecting user-community validated placement decisions. This grounding in authentic editing behavior ensures strong alignment between task definition and training supervision. User studies and quantitative evaluations show that StickerNet outperforms common baselines and closely matches human placement behavior, demonstrating the effectiveness of learning from real-world editing patterns despite the inherent ambiguity of the task. This work introduces a new direction in visual understanding that emphasizes expressiveness and user intent over realism.

Abstract: Traffic cameras are essential in urban areas, playing a crucial role in intelligent transportation systems. Multiple cameras at intersections enhance law enforcement capabilities, traffic management, and pedestrian safety. However, efficiently managing and analyzing multi-camera feeds poses challenges due to the vast amount of data. Analyzing such huge video data requires advanced analytical tools. While Large Language Models (LLMs) like ChatGPT, equipped with retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems, excel in text-based tasks, integrating them into traffic video analysis demands converting video data into text using a Vision-Language Model (VLM), which is time-consuming and delays the timely utilization of traffic videos for generating insights and investigating incidents. To address these challenges, we propose TrafficLens, a tailored algorithm for multi-camera traffic intersections. TrafficLens employs a sequential approach, utilizing overlapping coverage areas of cameras. It iteratively applies VLMs with varying token limits, using previous outputs as prompts for subsequent cameras, enabling rapid generation of detailed textual descriptions while reducing processing time. Additionally, TrafficLens intelligently bypasses redundant VLM invocations through an object-level similarity detector. Experimental results with real-world datasets demonstrate that TrafficLens reduces video-to-text conversion time by up to $4\times$ while maintaining information accuracy.

Abstract: Collaborative machine learning across healthcare institutions promises improved diagnostic accuracy by leveraging diverse datasets, yet privacy regulations such as HIPAA prohibit direct patient data sharing. While federated learning (FL) enables decentralized training without raw data exchange, recent studies show that model gradients in conventional FL remain vulnerable to reconstruction attacks, potentially exposing sensitive medical information. This paper presents a privacy-preserving federated learning framework combining Vision Transformers (ViT) with homomorphic encryption (HE) for secure multi-institutional histopathology classification. The approach leverages the ViT CLS token as a compact 768-dimensional feature representation for secure aggregation, encrypting these tokens using CKKS homomorphic encryption before transmission to the server. We demonstrate that encrypting CLS tokens achieves a 30-fold communication reduction compared to gradient encryption while maintaining strong privacy guarantees. Through evaluation on a three-client federated setup for lung cancer histopathology classification, we show that gradients are highly susceptible to model inversion attacks (PSNR: 52.26 dB, SSIM: 0.999, NMI: 0.741), enabling near-perfect image reconstruction. In contrast, the proposed CLS-protected HE approach prevents such attacks while enabling encrypted inference directly on ciphertexts, requiring only 326 KB of encrypted data transmission per aggregation round. The framework achieves 96.12 percent global classification accuracy in the unencrypted domain and 90.02 percent in the encrypted domain.

Abstract: Style transfer, a pivotal task in image processing, synthesizes visually compelling images by seamlessly blending realistic content with artistic styles, enabling applications in photo editing and creative design. While mainstream training-free diffusion-based methods have greatly advanced style transfer in recent years, their reliance on computationally inversion processes compromises efficiency and introduces visual distortions when inversion is inaccurate. To address these limitations, we propose a novel \textit{inversion-free} style transfer framework based on dual rectified flows, which tackles the challenge of finding an unknown stylized distribution from two distinct inputs (content and style images), \textit{only with forward pass}. Our approach predicts content and style trajectories in parallel, then fuses them through a dynamic midpoint interpolation that integrates velocities from both paths while adapting to the evolving stylized image. By jointly modeling the content, style, and stylized distributions, our velocity field design achieves robust fusion and avoids the shortcomings of naive overlays. Attention injection further guides style integration, enhancing visual fidelity, content preservation, and computational efficiency. Extensive experiments demonstrate generalization across diverse styles and content, providing an effective and efficient pipeline for style transfer.

Abstract: Referring Camouflaged Object Detection (Ref-COD) segments specified camouflaged objects in a scene by leveraging a small set of referring images. Though effective, current systems adopt a dual-branch design that requires reference images at test time, which limits deployability and adds latency and data-collection burden. We introduce a Ref-COD framework that distills references into a class-prototype memory during training and synthesizes a reference vector at inference via a query-conditioned mixture of prototypes. Concretely, we maintain an EMA-updated prototype per category and predict mixture weights from the query to produce a guidance vector without any test-time references. To bridge the representation gap between reference statistics and camouflaged query features, we propose a bidirectional attention alignment module that adapts both the query features and the class representation. Thus, our approach yields a simple, efficient path to Ref-COD without mandatory references. We evaluate the proposed method on the large-scale R2C7K benchmark. Extensive experiments demonstrate competitive or superior performance of the proposed method compared with recent state-of-the-arts. Code is available at https://github.com/yuhuan-wu/RefOnce.

Abstract: Accurately localizing and segmenting obscured objects from faint light patterns beyond the field of view is highly challenging due to multiple scattering and medium-induced perturbations. Most existing methods, based on real-valued modeling or local convolutional operations, are inadequate for capturing the underlying physics of coherent light propagation. Moreover, under low signal-to-noise conditions, these methods often converge to non-physical solutions, severely compromising the stability and reliability of the observation. To address these challenges, we propose a novel physics-driven Wavefront Propagating Compensation Network (WavePCNet) to simulate wavefront propagation and enhance the perception of obscured objects. This WavePCNet integrates the Tri-Phase Wavefront Complex-Propagation Reprojection (TriWCP) to incorporate complex amplitude transfer operators to precisely constrain coherent propagation behavior, along with a momentum memory mechanism to effectively suppress the accumulation of perturbations. Additionally, a High-frequency Cross-layer Compensation Enhancement is introduced to construct frequency-selective pathways with multi-scale receptive fields and dynamically model structural consistency across layers, further boosting the model's robustness and interpretability under complex environmental conditions. Extensive experiments conducted on four physically collected datasets demonstrate that WavePCNet consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods across both accuracy and robustness.

Abstract: Multimodal large reasoning models (MLRMs) are increasingly deployed for vision-language tasks that produce explicit intermediate rationales. However, reasoning traces can contain unsafe content even when the final answer is non-harmful, creating deployment risks. Existing multimodal safety guards primarily evaluate only the input question and the final answer, neglecting the intermediate reasoning process. This oversight allows undetected harm, such as biased inferences or policy-violating use of visual context, to emerge during reasoning. We introduce GuardTrace-VL, a vision-aware safety auditor that monitors the full Question-Thinking-Answer (QTA) pipeline via joint image-text analysis, enabling detection of unsafe content as it emerges in the reasoning stage. To support training and evaluation, we construct the GuardTrace dataset, which is generated through diverse prompting strategies and refined via a MLRM- and human-based voting and verification pipeline. Furthermore, we propose a three-stage progressive training scheme combined with the data refinement process, enabling the model to learn nuanced and context-dependent safety preferences according to different risk levels. On our proposed test set covering both in-domain and out-of-domain scenarios, GuardTrace-VL model achieves an F1 score of 93.1% on unsafe reasoning detection tasks, representing a 13.5% improvement in F1 score compared to the previous strongest multimodal safety defense methods. The codes will be made publicly available.

Abstract: Images can be viewed as layered compositions, foreground objects over background, with potential occlusions. This layered representation enables independent editing of elements, offering greater flexibility for content creation. Despite the progress in large generative models, decomposing a single image into layers remains challenging due to limited methods and data. We observe a strong connection between layer decomposition and in/outpainting tasks, and propose adapting a diffusion-based inpainting model for layer decomposition using lightweight finetuning. To further preserve detail in the latent space, we introduce a novel multi-modal context fusion module with linear attention complexity. Our model is trained purely on a synthetic dataset constructed from open-source assets and achieves superior performance in object removal and occlusion recovery, unlocking new possibilities in downstream editing and creative applications.

Abstract: News image captioning aims to produce journalistically informative descriptions by combining visual content with contextual cues from associated articles. Despite recent advances, existing methods struggle with three key challenges: (1) incomplete information coverage, (2) weak cross-modal alignment, and (3) suboptimal visual-entity grounding. To address these issues, we introduce MERGE, the first Multimodal Entity-aware Retrieval-augmented GEneration framework for news image captioning. MERGE constructs an entity-centric multimodal knowledge base (EMKB) that integrates textual, visual, and structured knowledge, enabling enriched background retrieval. It improves cross-modal alignment through a multistage hypothesis-caption strategy and enhances visual-entity matching via dynamic retrieval guided by image content. Extensive experiments on GoodNews and NYTimes800k show that MERGE significantly outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, with CIDEr gains of +6.84 and +1.16 in caption quality, and F1-score improvements of +4.14 and +2.64 in named entity recognition. Notably, MERGE also generalizes well to the unseen Visual News dataset, achieving +20.17 in CIDEr and +6.22 in F1-score, demonstrating strong robustness and domain adaptability.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Selecting an appropriate pre-trained source model is a critical, yet computationally expensive, task in transfer learning. Model Transferability Estimation (MTE) methods address this by providing efficient proxy metrics to rank models without full fine-tuning. In practice, the choice of which MTE metric to use is often ad hoc or guided simply by a metric's average historical performance. However, we observe that the effectiveness of MTE metrics is highly task-dependent and no single metric is universally optimal across all target datasets. To address this gap, we introduce MetaRank, a meta-learning framework for automatic, task-aware MTE metric selection. We formulate metric selection as a learning-to-rank problem. Rather than relying on conventional meta-features, MetaRank encodes textual descriptions of both datasets and MTE metrics using a pretrained language model, embedding them into a shared semantic space. A meta-predictor is then trained offline on diverse meta-tasks to learn the intricate relationship between dataset characteristics and metric mechanisms, optimized with a listwise objective that prioritizes correctly ranking the top-performing metrics. During the subsequent online phase, MetaRank efficiently ranks the candidate MTE metrics for a new, unseen target dataset based on its textual description, enabling practitioners to select the most appropriate metric a priori. Extensive experiments across 11 pretrained models and 11 target datasets demonstrate the strong effectiveness of our approach.

Abstract: Trustworthy multi-view classification (TMVC) addresses the challenge of achieving reliable decision-making in complex scenarios where multi-source information is heterogeneous, inconsistent, or even conflicting. Existing TMVC approaches predominantly rely on globally dense neighbor relationships to model intra-view dependencies, leading to high computational costs and an inability to directly ensure consistency across inter-view relationships. Furthermore, these methods typically aggregate evidence from different views through manually assigned weights, lacking guarantees that the learned multi-view neighbor structures are consistent within the class space, thus undermining the trustworthiness of classification outcomes. To overcome these limitations, we propose a novel TMVC framework that introduces prototypes to represent the neighbor structures of each view. By simplifying the learning of intra-view neighbor relations and enabling dynamic alignment of intra- and inter-view structure, our approach facilitates more efficient and consistent discovery of cross-view consensus. Extensive experiments on multiple public multi-view datasets demonstrate that our method achieves competitive downstream performance and robustness compared to prevalent TMVC methods.

Abstract: Text-guided diffusion models have greatly advanced image editing and generation. However, achieving physically consistent image retouching with precise parameter control (e.g., exposure, white balance, zoom) remains challenging. Existing methods either rely solely on ambiguous and entangled text prompts, which hinders precise camera control, or train separate heads/weights for parameter adjustment, which compromises scalability, multi-parameter composition, and sensitivity to subtle variations. To address these limitations, we propose CameraMaster, a unified camera-aware framework for image retouching. The key idea is to explicitly decouple the camera directive and then coherently integrate two critical information streams: a directive representation that captures the photographer's intent, and a parameter embedding that encodes precise camera settings. CameraMaster first uses the camera parameter embedding to modulate both the camera directive and the content semantics. The modulated directive is then injected into the content features via cross-attention, yielding a strongly camera-sensitive semantic context. In addition, the directive and camera embeddings are injected as conditioning and gating signals into the time embedding, enabling unified, layer-wise modulation throughout the denoising process and enforcing tight semantic-parameter alignment. To train and evaluate CameraMaster, we construct a large-scale dataset of 78K image-prompt pairs annotated with camera parameters. Extensive experiments show that CameraMaster produces monotonic and near-linear responses to parameter variations, supports seamless multi-parameter composition, and significantly outperforms existing methods.

Abstract: Image captions serve as efficient surrogates for visual content in multimodal systems such as retrieval, recommendation, and multi-step agentic inference pipelines. Yet current evaluation practices miss a fundamental question: Can captions stand-in for images in real downstream tasks? We propose a utility-based benchmark, CaptionQA, to evaluate model-generated captions, where caption quality is measured by how well it supports downstream tasks. CaptionQA is an extensible domain-dependent benchmark covering 4 domains--Natural, Document, E-commerce, and Embodied AI--each with fine-grained taxonomies (25 top-level and 69 subcategories) that identify useful information for domain-specific tasks. CaptionQA builds 33,027 densely annotated multiple-choice questions (50.3 per image on average) that explicitly require visual information to answer, providing a comprehensive probe of caption utility. In our evaluation protocol, an LLM answers these questions using captions alone, directly measuring whether captions preserve image-level utility and are utilizable by a downstream LLM. Evaluating state-of-the-art MLLMs reveals substantial gaps between the image and its caption utility. Notably, models nearly identical on traditional image-QA benchmarks lower by up to 32% in caption utility. We release CaptionQA along with an open-source pipeline for extension to new domains. The code is available at https://github.com/bronyayang/CaptionQA.

Abstract: Music-to-dance generation aims to translate auditory signals into expressive human motion, with broad applications in virtual reality, choreography, and digital entertainment. Despite promising progress, the limited generation efficiency of existing methods leaves insufficient computational headroom for high-fidelity 3D rendering, thereby constraining the expressiveness of 3D characters during real-world applications. Thus, we propose FlowerDance, which not only generates refined motion with physical plausibility and artistic expressiveness, but also achieves significant generation efficiency on inference speed and memory utilization . Specifically, FlowerDance combines MeanFlow with Physical Consistency Constraints, which enables high-quality motion generation with only a few sampling steps. Moreover, FlowerDance leverages a simple but efficient model architecture with BiMamba-based backbone and Channel-Level Cross-Modal Fusion, which generates dance with efficient non-autoregressive manner. Meanwhile, FlowerDance supports motion editing, enabling users to interactively refine dance sequences. Extensive experiments on AIST++ and FineDance show that FlowerDance achieves state-of-the-art results in both motion quality and generation efficiency. Code will be released upon acceptance.

Abstract: Diagnosing lung cancer typically involves physicians identifying lung nodules in Computed tomography (CT) scans and generating diagnostic reports based on their morphological features and medical expertise. Although advancements have been made in using multimodal large language models for analyzing lung CT scans, challenges remain in accurately describing nodule morphology and incorporating medical expertise. These limitations affect the reliability and effectiveness of these models in clinical settings. Collaborative multi-agent systems offer a promising strategy for achieving a balance between generality and precision in medical applications, yet their potential in pathology has not been thoroughly explored. To bridge these gaps, we introduce LungNoduleAgent, an innovative collaborative multi-agent system specifically designed for analyzing lung CT scans. LungNoduleAgent streamlines the diagnostic process into sequential components, improving precision in describing nodules and grading malignancy through three primary modules. The first module, the Nodule Spotter, coordinates clinical detection models to accurately identify nodules. The second module, the Radiologist, integrates localized image description techniques to produce comprehensive CT reports. Finally, the Doctor Agent System performs malignancy reasoning by using images and CT reports, supported by a pathology knowledge base and a multi-agent system framework. Extensive testing on two private datasets and the public LIDC-IDRI dataset indicates that LungNoduleAgent surpasses mainstream vision-language models, agent systems, and advanced expert models. These results highlight the importance of region-level semantic alignment and multi-agent collaboration in diagnosing nodules. LungNoduleAgent stands out as a promising foundational tool for supporting clinical analyses of lung nodules.

Abstract: Spatially varying image deblurring remains a fundamentally ill-posed problem, especially when degradations arise from complex mixtures of motion and other forms of blur under significant noise. State-of-the-art learning-based approaches generally fall into two paradigms: model-based deep unrolling methods that enforce physical constraints by modeling the degradations, but often produce over-smoothed, artifact-laden textures, and generative models that achieve superior perceptual quality yet hallucinate details due to weak physical constraints. In this paper, we propose a novel framework that uniquely reconciles these paradigms by taming a powerful generative prior with explicit, dense physical constraints. Rather than oversimplifying the degradation field, we model it as a dense continuum of high-dimensional compressed kernels, ensuring that minute variations in motion and other degradation patterns are captured. We leverage this rich descriptor field to condition a ControlNet architecture, strongly guiding the diffusion sampling process. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method effectively bridges the gap between physical accuracy and perceptual realism, outperforming state-of-the-art model-based methods as well as generative baselines in challenging, severely blurred scenarios.

Abstract: Images evoke emotions that profoundly influence perception, often prioritized over content. Current Image Emotional Synthesis (IES) approaches artificially separate generation and editing tasks, creating inefficiencies and limiting applications where these tasks naturally intertwine, such as therapeutic interventions or storytelling. In this work, we introduce MUSE, the first unified framework capable of both emotional generation and editing. By adopting a strategy conceptually aligned with Test-Time Scaling (TTS) that widely used in both LLM and diffusion model communities, it avoids the requirement for additional updating diffusion model and specialized emotional synthesis datasets. More specifically, MUSE addresses three key questions in emotional synthesis: (1) HOW to stably guide synthesis by leveraging an off-the-shelf emotion classifier with gradient-based optimization of emotional tokens; (2) WHEN to introduce emotional guidance by identifying the optimal timing using semantic similarity as a supervisory signal; and (3) WHICH emotion to guide synthesis through a multi-emotion loss that reduces interference from inherent and similar emotions. Experimental results show that MUSE performs favorably against all methods for both generation and editing, improving emotional accuracy and semantic diversity while maintaining an optimal balance between desired content, adherence to text prompts, and realistic emotional expression. It establishes a new paradigm for emotion synthesis.

Abstract: Image generation can provide physicians with an imaging diagnosis basis in the prediction of Alzheimer's Disease (AD). Recent research has shown that long-term AD predictions by image generation often face difficulties maintaining disease-related characteristics when dealing with irregular time intervals in sequential data. Considering that the time-related aspects of the distribution can reflect changes in disease-related characteristics when images are distributed unevenly, this research proposes a model to estimate the temporal parameter within the Normal Inverse Gamma Distribution (T-NIG) to assist in generating images over the long term. The T-NIG model employs brain images from two different time points to create intermediate brain images, forecast future images, and predict the disease. T-NIG is designed by identifying features using coordinate neighborhoods. It incorporates a time parameter into the normal inverse gamma distribution to understand how features change in brain imaging sequences that have varying time intervals. Additionally, T-NIG utilizes uncertainty estimation to reduce both epistemic and aleatoric uncertainties in the model, which arise from insufficient temporal data. In particular, the T-NIG model demonstrates state-of-the-art performance in both short-term and long-term prediction tasks within the dataset. Experimental results indicate that T-NIG is proficient in forecasting disease progression while maintaining disease-related characteristics, even when faced with an irregular temporal data distribution.

Abstract: Instruction-guided image editing offers an intuitive way for users to edit images with natural language. However, diffusion-based editing models often struggle to accurately interpret complex user instructions, especially those involving compositional relationships, contextual cues, or referring expressions, leading to edits that drift semantically or fail to reflect the intended changes. We tackle this problem by proposing MIRA (Multimodal Iterative Reasoning Agent), a lightweight, plug-and-play multimodal reasoning agent that performs editing through an iterative perception-reasoning-action loop, effectively simulating multi-turn human-model interaction processes. Instead of issuing a single prompt or static plan, MIRA predicts atomic edit instructions step by step, using visual feedback to make its decisions. Our 150K multimodal tool-use dataset, MIRA-Editing, combined with a two-stage SFT + GRPO training pipeline, enables MIRA to perform reasoning and editing over complex editing instructions. When paired with open-source image editing models such as Flux.1-Kontext, Step1X-Edit, and Qwen-Image-Edit, MIRA significantly improves both semantic consistency and perceptual quality, achieving performance comparable to or exceeding proprietary systems such as GPT-Image and Nano-Banana.

Abstract: Iris authentication algorithms have achieved impressive recognition performance, making them highly promising for real-world applications such as border control, citizen identification, and both criminal investigations and commercial systems. However, their robustness is still challenged by variations in rotation, scale, specular reflections, and defocus blur. In addition, most existing approaches rely on straightforward point-to-point comparisons, typically using cosine or L2 distance, without effectively leveraging the spatio-spatial-temporal structure of iris patterns. To address these limitations, we propose a novel and generalized matching pipeline that learns rich spatio-spatial-temporal representations of iris features. Our approach first splits each iris image along one dimension, generating a sequence of sub-images that serve as input to a 3D-CNN, enabling the network to capture both spatial and spatio-spatial-temporal cues. To further enhance the modeling of spatio-spatial-temporal feature dynamics, we train the model in curriculum manner. This design allows the network to embed temporal dependencies directly into the feature space, improving discriminability in the deep metric domain. The framework is trained end-to-end with triplet and ArcFace loss in a curriculum manner, enforcing highly discriminative embeddings despite challenges like rotation, scale, reflections, and blur. This design yields a robust and generalizable solution for iris authentication.Github code: https://github.com/GeetanjaliGTZ/CLRecogEye

Abstract: Understanding reflection remains a long-standing challenge in 3D reconstruction due to the entanglement of appearance and geometry under view-dependent reflections. In this work, we present the Pygmalion Effect in Vision, a novel framework that metaphorically "sculpts" reflective objects into clay-like forms through image-to-clay translation. Inspired by the myth of Pygmalion, our method learns to suppress specular cues while preserving intrinsic geometric consistency, enabling robust reconstruction from multi-view images containing complex reflections. Specifically, we introduce a dual-branch network in which a BRDF-based reflective branch is complemented by a clay-guided branch that stabilizes geometry and refines surface normals. The two branches are trained jointly using the synthesized clay-like images, which provide a neutral, reflection-free supervision signal that complements the reflective views. Experiments on both synthetic and real datasets demonstrate substantial improvement in normal accuracy and mesh completeness over existing reflection-handling methods. Beyond technical gains, our framework reveals that seeing by unshining, translating radiance into neutrality, can serve as a powerful inductive bias for reflective object geometry learning.

Abstract: Radar sensors provide reliable perception across adverse weather, lighting, and long-range conditions. Recent advances in foundation models have transformed visual and language understanding, yet their integration with radar sensing remains largely underexplored. Existing radar approaches are fragmented and task-specific; each downstream task employs distinct architectures and training objectives, preventing transfer across tasks. In this work, we introduce RadarFM: a radar foundation model that learns unified scene-level representations through structured spatial language supervision. We make two key contributions: (1) a structured caption framework that encodes vehicle distributions in native radar coordinates, and (2) a hash-aware contrastive learning objective that quantifies continuous scene similarity rather than binary matching, enabling fine-grained spatial reasoning. Leveraging the CARLA simulator, we generate large-scale, well-annotated radar datasets across diverse driving scenarios. We also propose localization-aware metrics that assess spatial accuracy beyond traditional detection measures.

Abstract: Efficient Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) compress vision tokens to reduce resource consumption, but the loss of visual information can degrade comprehension capabilities. Although some priors introduce Knowledge Distillation to enhance student models, they overlook the fundamental differences in fine-grained vision comprehension caused by unbalanced vision tokens between the efficient student and vanilla teacher. In this paper, we propose EM-KD, a novel paradigm that enhances the Efficient MLLMs with Knowledge Distillation. To overcome the challenge of unbalanced vision tokens, we first calculate the Manhattan distance between the vision logits of teacher and student, and then align them in the spatial dimension with the Hungarian matching algorithm. After alignment, EM-KD introduces two distillation strategies: 1) Vision-Language Affinity Distillation (VLAD) and 2) Vision Semantic Distillation (VSD). Specifically, VLAD calculates the affinity matrix between text tokens and aligned vision tokens, and minimizes the smooth L1 distance of the student and the teacher affinity matrices. Considering the semantic richness of vision logits in the final layer, VSD employs the reverse KL divergence to measure the discrete probability distributions of the aligned vision logits over the vocabulary space. Comprehensive evaluation on diverse benchmarks demonstrates that EM-KD trained model outperforms prior Efficient MLLMs on both accuracy and efficiency with a large margin, validating its effectiveness. Compared with previous distillation methods, which are equipped with our proposed vision token matching strategy for fair comparison, EM-KD also achieves better performance.

Abstract: In controllable driving-scene reconstruction and 3D scene generation, maintaining geometric fidelity while synthesizing visually plausible appearance under large viewpoint shifts is crucial. However, effective fusion of geometry-based 3DGS and appearance-driven diffusion models faces inherent challenges, as the absence of pixel-wise, 3D-consistent editing criteria often leads to over-restoration and geometric drift. To address these issues, we introduce \textbf{FaithFusion}, a 3DGS-diffusion fusion framework driven by pixel-wise Expected Information Gain (EIG). EIG acts as a unified policy for coherent spatio-temporal synthesis: it guides diffusion as a spatial prior to refine high-uncertainty regions, while its pixel-level weighting distills the edits back into 3DGS. The resulting plug-and-play system is free from extra prior conditions and structural modifications.Extensive experiments on the Waymo dataset demonstrate that our approach attains SOTA performance across NTA-IoU, NTL-IoU, and FID, maintaining an FID of 107.47 even at 6 meters lane shift. Our code is available at https://github.com/wangyuanbiubiubiu/FaithFusion.

Abstract: Alzheimer's disease (AD), a degenerative brain condition, can benefit from early prediction to slow its progression. As the disease progresses, patients typically undergo brain atrophy. Current prediction methods for Alzheimers disease largely involve analyzing morphological changes in brain images through manual feature extraction. This paper proposes a novel method, the Deformation-Aware Temporal Generative Network (DATGN), to automate the learning of morphological changes in brain images about disease progression for early prediction. Given the common occurrence of missing data in the temporal sequences of MRI images, DATGN initially interpolates incomplete sequences. Subsequently, a bidirectional temporal deformation-aware module guides the network in generating future MRI images that adhere to the disease's progression, facilitating early prediction of Alzheimer's disease. DATGN was tested for the generation of temporal sequences of future MRI images using the ADNI dataset, and the experimental results are competitive in terms of PSNR and MMSE image quality metrics. Furthermore, when DATGN-generated synthetic data was integrated into the SVM vs. CNN vs. 3DCNN-based classification methods, significant improvements were achieved from 6. 21\% to 16\% in AD vs. NC classification accuracy and from 7. 34\% to 21. 25\% in AD vs. MCI vs. NC classification accuracy. The qualitative visualization results indicate that DATGN produces MRI images consistent with the brain atrophy trend in Alzheimer's disease, enabling early disease prediction.

Abstract: Large-scale vision generative models, including diffusion and flow models, have demonstrated remarkable performance in visual generation tasks. However, transferring these pre-trained models to downstream tasks often results in significant parameter redundancy. In this paper, we propose EntPruner, an entropy-guided automatic progressive pruning framework for diffusion and flow models. First, we introduce entropy-guided pruning, a block-level importance assessment strategy specifically designed for generative models. Unlike discriminative models, generative models require preserving the diversity and condition-fidelity of the output distribution. As the importance of each module can vary significantly across downstream tasks, EntPruner prioritizes pruning of less important blocks using data-dependent Conditional Entropy Deviation (CED) as a guiding metric. CED quantifies how much the distribution diverges from the learned conditional data distribution after removing a block. Second, we propose a zero-shot adaptive pruning framework to automatically determine when and how much to prune during training. This dynamic strategy avoids the pitfalls of one-shot pruning, mitigating mode collapse, and preserving model performance. Extensive experiments on DiT and SiT models demonstrate the effectiveness of EntPruner, achieving up to 2.22$\times$ inference speedup while maintaining competitive generation quality on ImageNet and three downstream datasets.

Abstract: We tackle the dual challenges of video understanding and controllable video generation within a unified diffusion framework. Our key insights are two-fold: geometry-only cues (e.g., depth, edges) are insufficient: they specify layout but under-constrain appearance, materials, and illumination, limiting physically meaningful edits such as relighting or material swaps and often causing temporal drift. Enriching the model with additional graphics-based modalities (intrinsics and semantics) provides complementary constraints that both disambiguate understanding and enable precise, predictable control during generation.
  However, building a single model that uses many heterogeneous cues introduces two core difficulties. Architecturally, the model must accept any subset of modalities, remain robust to missing inputs, and inject control signals without sacrificing temporal consistency. Data-wise, training demands large-scale, temporally aligned supervision that ties real videos to per-pixel multimodal annotations.
  We then propose CtrlVDiff, a unified diffusion model trained with a Hybrid Modality Control Strategy (HMCS) that routes and fuses features from depth, normals, segmentation, edges, and graphics-based intrinsics (albedo, roughness, metallic), and re-renders videos from any chosen subset with strong temporal coherence. To enable this, we build MMVideo, a hybrid real-and-synthetic dataset aligned across modalities and captions. Across understanding and generation benchmarks, CtrlVDiff delivers superior controllability and fidelity, enabling layer-wise edits (relighting, material adjustment, object insertion) and surpassing state-of-the-art baselines while remaining robust when some modalities are unavailable.

Abstract: It is well-known that if a network aims to learn how to deblur, it should understand the blur process. Blurring is naturally caused by the convolution of the sharp image with the blur kernel. Thus, allowing the network to learn the blur process in the kernel-level can significantly improve the image deblurring performance. But, current deep networks are still at the pixel-level learning stage, either performing end-to-end pixel-level restoration or stage-wise pseudo kernel-level restoration, failing to enable the deblur model to understand the essence of the blur. To this end, we propose Fourier Kernel Estimator (FKE), which considers the activation operation in Fourier space and converts the convolution problem in the spatial domain to a multiplication problem in Fourier space. Our FKE, jointly optimized with the deblur model, enables the network to learn the kernel-level blur process with low complexity and without any additional supervision. Furthermore, we change the convolution object of the kernel from ``image" to network extracted ``feature", whose rich semantic and structural information is more suitable to blur process learning. With the convolution of the feature and the estimated kernel, our model can learn the essence of blur in kernel-level. To further improve the efficiency of feature extraction, we design a decoupled multi-scale architecture with multiple hierarchical sub-unets with a reversible strategy, which allows better multi-scale encoding and decoding in low training memory. Extensive experiments indicate that our method achieves state-of-the-art motion deblurring results and show potential for handling other kernel-related problems. Analysis also shows our kernel estimator is able to learn physically meaningful kernels. The code will be available at https://github.com/DeepMed-Lab-ECNU/Single-Image-Deblur.

Abstract: Human video generation has advanced rapidly with the development of diffusion models, but the high computational cost and substantial memory consumption associated with training these models on high-resolution, multi-frame data pose significant challenges. In this paper, we propose Entropy-Guided Prioritized Progressive Learning (Ent-Prog), an efficient training framework tailored for diffusion models on human video generation. First, we introduce Conditional Entropy Inflation (CEI) to assess the importance of different model components on the target conditional generation task, enabling prioritized training of the most critical components. Second, we introduce an adaptive progressive schedule that adaptively increases computational complexity during training by measuring the convergence efficiency. Ent-Prog reduces both training time and GPU memory consumption while maintaining model performance. Extensive experiments across three datasets, demonstrate the effectiveness of Ent-Prog, achieving up to 2.2$\times$ training speedup and 2.4$\times$ GPU memory reduction without compromising generative performance.

Abstract: Text-to-Video (T2V) models are capable of synthesizing high-quality, temporally coherent dynamic video content, but the diverse generation also inherently introduces critical safety challenges. Existing safety evaluation methods,which focus on static image and text generation, are insufficient to capture the complex temporal dynamics in video generation. To address this, we propose a TEmporal-aware Automated Red-teaming framework, named TEAR, an automated framework designed to uncover safety risks specifically linked to the dynamic temporal sequencing of T2V models. TEAR employs a temporal-aware test generator optimized via a two-stage approach: initial generator training and temporal-aware online preference learning, to craft textually innocuous prompts that exploit temporal dynamics to elicit policy-violating video output. And a refine model is adopted to improve the prompt stealthiness and adversarial effectiveness cyclically. Extensive experimental evaluation demonstrates the effectiveness of TEAR across open-source and commercial T2V systems with over 80% attack success rate, a significant boost from prior best result of 57%.

Abstract: Visual encoding followed by token condensing has become the standard architectural paradigm in multi-modal large language models (MLLMs). Many recent MLLMs increasingly favor global native- resolution visual encoding over slice-based methods. To investigate this trend, we systematically compare their behavior on vision-language understanding and attention patterns, revealing that global encoding enhances overall capability but at the expense of greater computational overhead. To address this issue, we present LLaVA-UHD v3, an MLLM centered upon our proposed Progressive Visual Compression (PVC) method, which can be seamlessly integrated into standard Vision Transformer (ViT) to enable efficient native-resolution encoding. The PVC approach consists of two key modules: (i) refined patch embedding, which supports flexible patch-size scaling for fine-grained visual model- ing, (ii) windowed token compression, hierarchically deployed across ViT layers to progressively aggregate local token representations. Jointly modulated by these two modules, a widely pretrained ViT can be reconfigured into an efficient architecture while largely preserving generality. Evaluated across extensive benchmarks, the transformed ViT, termed ViT-UHD, demonstrates competitive performance with MoonViT while reducing TTFT (time-to-first-token) by 2.4x, when developed within an identical MLLM architecture. Building upon ViT-UHD, LLaVA-UHD v3 also achieves competitive performance to Qwen2-VL, while further reducing TTFT by 1.9x.

Abstract: Recent visual autoregressive (AR) models have shown promising capabilities in text-to-image generation, operating in a manner similar to large language models. While test-time computation scaling has brought remarkable success in enabling reasoning-enhanced outputs for challenging natural language tasks, its adaptation to visual AR models remains unexplored and poses unique challenges. Naively applying test-time scaling strategies such as Best-of-N can be suboptimal: they consume full-length computation on erroneous generation trajectories, while the raster-scan decoding scheme lacks a blueprint of the entire canvas, limiting scaling benefits as only a few prompt-aligned candidates are generated. To address these, we introduce GridAR, a test-time scaling framework designed to elicit the best possible results from visual AR models. GridAR employs a grid-partitioned progressive generation scheme in which multiple partial candidates for the same position are generated within a canvas, infeasible ones are pruned early, and viable ones are fixed as anchors to guide subsequent decoding. Coupled with this, we present a layout-specified prompt reformulation strategy that inspects partial views to infer a feasible layout for satisfying the prompt. The reformulated prompt then guides subsequent image generation to mitigate the blueprint deficiency. Together, GridAR achieves higher-quality results under limited test-time scaling: with N=4, it even outperforms Best-of-N (N=8) by 14.4% on T2I-CompBench++ while reducing cost by 25.6%. It also generalizes to autoregressive image editing, showing comparable edit quality and a 13.9% gain in semantic preservation on PIE-Bench over larger-N baselines.

Abstract: Existing prompt learning methods, which are built upon CLIP models, leverage textual tokens as anchors to guide the learnable soft tokens. This guidance improves CLIP generalizations. However, these anchors-static in both value and position-lack cross-task and stage-adaptive flexibility. To address this limitation, we propose AnchorOPT, a dynamic anchor-based prompt learning framework. Specifically, AnchorOPT introduces dynamism in two key dimensions: (i) anchor values eschew handcrafted explicit textual tokens (e.g., "shape", "color"), instead learning dynamically from task-specific data; and (ii) the positional relationship between anchor and soft tokens is no longer fixed but adaptively optimized via a learnable position matrix conditioned on the training stage and task context. Training occurs in two stages: we first learn the anchor tokens, then freeze and transfer them to the second stage for optimization of soft tokens and the position matrix. Extensive experiments demonstrate that using only a simple learnable anchor and position matrix achieves performance comparable to or exceeding some methods incorporating additional learnable modules or regularization techniques. As a plug-and-play module, AnchorOPT integrates seamlessly into existing frameworks, yielding consistent performance gains across diverse datasets. Code is publicly available at https://github.com/zhengli97/ATPrompt.

Abstract: Recent advances in 3D vision-language models (VLMs) highlight a strong potential for 3D scene understanding and reasoning. However, effectively tokenizing 3D scenes into holistic scene tokens, and leveraging these tokens across diverse 3D understanding tasks, remain highly challenging. We present NDTokenizer3D, a generalist 3D VLM that performs a wide range of 3D scene understanding tasks while naturally supporting human interactions, thereby bridging language-level reasoning with 3D spatial understanding. The core of our approach is a novel three-stage scene tokenization pipeline built upon a Multi-Scale Normal Distributions Transform (NDT) representation, paired with a Multi-Scale NDT Decoder (MSDec). Specifically, NDTokenizer3D first constructs a multi-scale NDT representation from raw high-resolution point clouds, preserving both global context and fine-grained geometric details. Next, the MSDec progressively fuses cross-scale NDT features, producing holistic scene tokens consumable by LLM endpoints. Beyond tokenization, MSDec is repurposed as a general interface for human-interactive prompting (points, boxes, masks) and segmentation-mask decoding, unifying diverse 3D scene understanding tasks within a single architecture. With this compact and unified design, NDTokenizer3D offers a fine-grained, general-purpose 3D VLM, achieving remarkable improvements in 3D Referring Segmentation, 3D Visual Question Answering, and 3D Dense Captioning.

Abstract: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models are vulnerable to adversarial attacks, yet universal and transferable attacks remain underexplored, as most existing patches overfit to a single model and fail in black-box settings. To address this gap, we present a systematic study of universal, transferable adversarial patches against VLA-driven robots under unknown architectures, finetuned variants, and sim-to-real shifts. We introduce UPA-RFAS (Universal Patch Attack via Robust Feature, Attention, and Semantics), a unified framework that learns a single physical patch in a shared feature space while promoting cross-model transfer. UPA-RFAS combines (i) a feature-space objective with an $\ell_1$ deviation prior and repulsive InfoNCE loss to induce transferable representation shifts, (ii) a robustness-augmented two-phase min-max procedure where an inner loop learns invisible sample-wise perturbations and an outer loop optimizes the universal patch against this hardened neighborhood, and (iii) two VLA-specific losses: Patch Attention Dominance to hijack text$\to$vision attention and Patch Semantic Misalignment to induce image-text mismatch without labels. Experiments across diverse VLA models, manipulation suites, and physical executions show that UPA-RFAS consistently transfers across models, tasks, and viewpoints, exposing a practical patch-based attack surface and establishing a strong baseline for future defenses.

Abstract: Recent deep clustering models have produced impressive clustering performance. However, a common issue with existing methods is the disparity between global and local feature structures. While local structures typically show strong consistency and compactness within class samples, global features often present intertwined boundaries and poorly separated clusters. Motivated by this observation, we propose DCBoost, a parameter-free plug-in designed to enhance the global feature structures of current deep clustering models. By harnessing reliable local structural cues, our method aims to elevate clustering performance effectively. Specifically, we first identify high-confidence samples through adaptive $k$-nearest neighbors-based consistency filtering, aiming to select a sufficient number of samples with high label reliability to serve as trustworthy anchors for self-supervision. Subsequently, these samples are utilized to compute a discriminative loss, which promotes both intra-class compactness and inter-class separability, to guide network optimization. Extensive experiments across various benchmark datasets showcase that our DCBoost significantly improves the clustering performance of diverse existing deep clustering models. Notably, our method improves the performance of current state-of-the-art baselines (e.g., ProPos) by more than 3% and amplifies the silhouette coefficient by over $7\times$.

Abstract: Foundation models have demonstrated a remarkable ability to learn rich, transferable representations across diverse modalities such as images, text, and audio. In modern machine learning pipelines, these representations often replace raw data as the primary input for downstream tasks. In this paper, we address the challenge of adapting a pre-trained foundation model to inject domain-specific knowledge, without retraining from scratch or incurring significant computational costs. To this end, we introduce BotaCLIP, a lightweight multimodal contrastive framework that adapts a pre-trained Earth Observation foundation model (DOFA) by aligning high-resolution aerial imagery with botanical relevés. Unlike generic embeddings, BotaCLIP internalizes ecological structure through contrastive learning with a regularization strategy that mitigates catastrophic forgetting. Once trained, the resulting embeddings serve as transferable representations for downstream predictors. Motivated by real-world applications in biodiversity modeling, we evaluated BotaCLIP representations in three ecological tasks: plant presence prediction, butterfly occurrence modeling, and soil trophic group abundance estimation. The results showed consistent improvements over those derived from DOFA and supervised baselines. More broadly, this work illustrates how domain-aware adaptation of foundation models can inject expert knowledge into data-scarce settings, enabling frugal representation learning.

Abstract: Fine-grained action recognition (FGAR) aims to identify subtle and distinctive differences among fine-grained action categories. However, current recognition methods often capture coarse-grained motion patterns but struggle to identify subtle details in local regions evolving over time. In this work, we introduce the Action-Region Tracking (ART) framework, a novel solution leveraging a query-response mechanism to discover and track the dynamics of distinctive local details, enabling effective distinction of similar actions. Specifically, we propose a region-specific semantic activation module that employs discriminative and text-constrained semantics as queries to capture the most action-related region responses in each video frame, facilitating interaction among spatial and temporal dimensions with corresponding video features. The captured region responses are organized into action tracklets, which characterize region-based action dynamics by linking related responses across video frames in a coherent sequence. The text-constrained queries encode nuanced semantic representations derived from textual descriptions of action labels extracted by language branches within Visual Language Models (VLMs). To optimize the action tracklets, we design a multi-level tracklet contrastive constraint among region responses at spatial and temporal levels, enabling effective discrimination within each frame and correlation between adjacent frames. Additionally, a task-specific fine-tuning mechanism refines textual semantics such that semantic representations encoded by VLMs are preserved while optimized for task preferences. Comprehensive experiments on widely used action recognition benchmarks demonstrate the superiority to previous state-of-the-art baselines.

Abstract: We present a comprehensive comparative study of three generative modeling paradigms: Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models (DDPM), Conditional Flow Matching (CFM), and MeanFlow. While DDPM and CFM require iterative sampling, MeanFlow enables direct one-step generation by modeling the average velocity over time intervals. We implement all three methods using a unified TinyUNet architecture (<1.5M parameters) on CIFAR-10, demonstrating that CFM achieves an FID of 24.15 with 50 steps, significantly outperforming DDPM (FID 402.98). MeanFlow achieves FID 29.15 with single-step sampling -- a 50X reduction in inference time. We further extend CFM to image inpainting, implementing mask-guided sampling with four mask types (center, random bbox, irregular, half). Our fine-tuned inpainting model achieves substantial improvements: PSNR increases from 4.95 to 8.57 dB on center masks (+73%), and SSIM improves from 0.289 to 0.418 (+45%), demonstrating the effectiveness of inpainting-aware training.

Abstract: Facial expressions convey the bulk of emotional information in human communication, yet existing 3D face reconstruction methods often miss subtle affective details due to reliance on 2D supervision and lack of 3D ground truth. We propose FIELDS (Face reconstruction with accurate Inference of Expression using Learning with Direct Supervision) to address these limitations by extending self-supervised 2D image consistency cues with direct 3D expression parameter supervision and an auxiliary emotion recognition branch. Our encoder is guided by authentic expression parameters from spontaneous 4D facial scans, while an intensity-aware emotion loss encourages the 3D expression parameters to capture genuine emotion content without exaggeration. This dual-supervision strategy bridges the 2D/3D domain gap and mitigates expression-intensity bias, yielding high-fidelity 3D reconstructions that preserve subtle emotional cues. From a single image, FIELDS produces emotion-rich face models with highly realistic expressions, significantly improving in-the-wild facial expression recognition performance without sacrificing naturalness.

Abstract: Convolutional neural networks have shown remarkable performance in recent years on various computer vision problems. However, the traditional convolutional neural network architecture lacks a critical property: shift equivariance and invariance, broken by downsampling and upsampling operations. Although data augmentation techniques can help the model learn the latter property empirically, a consistent and systematic way to achieve this goal is by designing downsampling and upsampling layers that theoretically guarantee these properties by construction. Adaptive Polyphase Sampling (APS) introduced the cornerstone for shift invariance, later extended to shift equivariance with Learnable Polyphase up/downsampling (LPS) applied to real-valued neural networks. In this paper, we extend the work on LPS to complex-valued neural networks both from a theoretical perspective and with a novel building block of a projection layer from $\mathbb{C}$ to $\mathbb{R}$ before the Gumbel Softmax. We finally evaluate this extension on several computer vision problems, specifically for either the invariance property in classification tasks or the equivariance property in both reconstruction and semantic segmentation problems, using polarimetric Synthetic Aperture Radar images.

Abstract: The threat of Audio-Video (AV) forgery is rapidly evolving beyond human-centric deepfakes to include more diverse manipulations across complex natural scenes. However, existing benchmarks are still confined to DeepFake-based forgeries and single-granularity annotations, thus failing to capture the diversity and complexity of real-world forgery scenarios. To address this, we introduce AVFakeBench, the first comprehensive audio-video forgery detection benchmark that spans rich forgery semantics across both human subject and general subject. AVFakeBench comprises 12K carefully curated audio-video questions, covering seven forgery types and four levels of annotations. To ensure high-quality and diverse forgeries, we propose a multi-stage hybrid forgery framework that integrates proprietary models for task planning with expert generative models for precise manipulation. The benchmark establishes a multi-task evaluation framework covering binary judgment, forgery types classification, forgery detail selection, and explanatory reasoning. We evaluate 11 Audio-Video Large Language Models (AV-LMMs) and 2 prevalent detection methods on AVFakeBench, demonstrating the potential of AV-LMMs as emerging forgery detectors while revealing their notable weaknesses in fine-grained perception and reasoning.

Abstract: Generative world models for autonomous driving (AD) have become a trending topic. Unlike the widely studied image modality, in this work we explore generative world models for LiDAR data. Existing generation methods for LiDAR data only support single frame generation, while existing prediction approaches require multiple frames of historical input and can only deterministically predict multiple frames at once, lacking interactivity. Both paradigms fail to support long-horizon interactive generation. To this end, we introduce LaGen, which to the best of our knowledge is the first framework capable of frame-by-frame autoregressive generation of long-horizon LiDAR scenes. LaGen is able to take a single-frame LiDAR input as a starting point and effectively utilize bounding box information as conditions to generate high-fidelity 4D scene point clouds. In addition, we introduce a scene decoupling estimation module to enhance the model's interactive generation capability for object-level content, as well as a noise modulation module to mitigate error accumulation during long-horizon generation. We construct a protocol based on nuScenes for evaluating long-horizon LiDAR scene generation. Experimental results comprehensively demonstrate LaGen outperforms state-of-the-art LiDAR generation and prediction models, especially on the later frames.

Abstract: Learning-based image matching critically depends on large-scale, diverse, and geometrically accurate training data. 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) enables photorealistic novel-view synthesis and thus is attractive for data generation. However, its geometric inaccuracies and biased depth rendering currently prevent robust correspondence labeling. To address this, we introduce MatchGS, the first framework designed to systematically correct and leverage 3DGS for robust, zero-shot image matching. Our approach is twofold: (1) a geometrically-faithful data generation pipeline that refines 3DGS geometry to produce highly precise correspondence labels, enabling the synthesis of a vast and diverse range of viewpoints without compromising rendering fidelity; and (2) a 2D-3D representation alignment strategy that infuses 3DGS' explicit 3D knowledge into the 2D matcher, guiding 2D semi-dense matchers to learn viewpoint-invariant 3D representations. Our generated ground-truth correspondences reduce the epipolar error by up to 40 times compared to existing datasets, enable supervision under extreme viewpoint changes, and provide self-supervisory signals through Gaussian attributes. Consequently, state-of-the-art matchers trained solely on our data achieve significant zero-shot performance gains on public benchmarks, with improvements of up to 17.7%. Our work demonstrates that with proper geometric refinement, 3DGS can serve as a scalable, high-fidelity, and structurally-rich data source, paving the way for a new generation of robust zero-shot image matchers.

Abstract: With Transformers achieving outstanding performance on individual remote sensing (RS) tasks, we are now approaching the realization of a unified model that excels across multiple tasks through multi-task learning (MTL). Compared to single-task approaches, MTL methods offer improved generalization, enhanced scalability, and greater practical applicability. Recently, vision language models (VLMs) have achieved promising results in RS image understanding, grounding, and ultra-high-resolution (UHR) image reasoning, respectively. Moreover, the unified text-based interface demonstrates significant potential for MTL. Hence, in this work, we present RSCoVLM, a simple yet flexible VLM baseline for RS MTL. Firstly, we create the data curation engine, including data acquisition, offline processing and integrating, as well as online loading and weighting. This data engine effectively addresses complex RS data enviroment and generates flexible vision-language conversations. Furthermore, we propose a unified dynamic-resolution strategy to address the diverse image scales inherent in RS imagery. For UHR images, we introduce the Zoom-in Chain mechanism together with its corresponding dataset, LRS-VQA-Zoom. The strategies are flexible and effectively mitigate the computational burdens. Additionally, we significantly enhance the model's object detection capability and propose a novel evaluation protocol that ensures fair comparison between VLMs and conventional detection models. Extensive experiments demonstrate that RSCoVLM achieves state-of-the-art performance across diverse tasks, outperforming existing RS VLMs and even rivaling specialized expert models. All the training and evaluating tools, model weights, and datasets have been fully open-sourced to support reproducibility. We expect that this baseline will promote further progress toward general-purpose RS models.

Abstract: Achieving both high accuracy and topological continuity in road segmentation from satellite imagery is a critical goal for applications ranging from urban planning to disaster response. State-of-the-art methods often rely on Vision Transformers, which excel at capturing global context, yet their quadratic complexity is a significant barrier to efficient deployment, particularly for on-board processing in resource-constrained platforms. In contrast, emerging State Space Models like Mamba offer linear-time efficiency and are inherently suited to modeling long, continuous structures. We posit that these architectures have complementary strengths. To this end, we introduce PathMamba, a novel hybrid architecture that integrates Mamba's sequential modeling with the Transformer's global reasoning. Our design strategically uses Mamba blocks to trace the continuous nature of road networks, preserving topological structure, while integrating Transformer blocks to refine features with global context. This approach yields topologically superior segmentation maps without the prohibitive scaling costs of pure attention-based models. Our experiments on the DeepGlobe Road Extraction and Massachusetts Roads datasets demonstrate that PathMamba sets a new state-of-the-art. Notably, it significantly improves topological continuity, as measured by the APLS metric, setting a new benchmark while remaining computationally competitive.

Abstract: Despite major advances brought by diffusion-based models, current 3D texture generation systems remain hindered by cross-view inconsistency -- textures that appear convincing from one viewpoint often fail to align across others. We find that this issue arises from attention ambiguity, where unstructured full attention is applied indiscriminately across tokens and modalities, causing geometric confusion and unstable appearance-structure coupling. To address this, we introduce CaliTex, a framework of geometry-calibrated attention that explicitly aligns attention with 3D structure. It introduces two modules: Part-Aligned Attention that enforces spatial alignment across semantically matched parts, and Condition-Routed Attention which routes appearance information through geometry-conditioned pathways to maintain spatial fidelity. Coupled with a two-stage diffusion transformer, CaliTex makes geometric coherence an inherent behavior of the network rather than a byproduct of optimization. Empirically, CaliTex produces seamless and view-consistent textures and outperforms both open-source and commercial baselines.

Abstract: The Visual Geometry Grounded Transformer (VGGT) marks a significant leap forward in 3D scene reconstruction, as it is the first model that directly infers all key 3D attributes (camera poses, depths, and dense geometry) jointly in one pass. However, this joint inference mechanism requires global attention layers that perform all-to-all attention computation on tokens from all views. For reconstruction of large scenes with long-sequence inputs, this causes a significant latency bottleneck. In this paper, we propose head-wise temporal merging (HTTM), a training-free 3D token merging method for accelerating VGGT. Existing merging techniques merge tokens uniformly across different attention heads, resulting in identical tokens in the layers' output, which hinders the model's representational ability. HTTM tackles this problem by merging tokens in multi-head granularity, which preserves the uniqueness of feature tokens after head concatenation. Additionally, this enables HTTM to leverage the spatial locality and temporal correspondence observed at the head level to achieve higher merging ratios with lower merging costs compared to existing methods. Thus, HTTM achieves up to 7x acceleration with negligible performance drops in a GPU-based inference.

Abstract: Learning joint representations across multiple modalities remains a central challenge in multimodal machine learning. Prevailing approaches predominantly operate in pairwise settings, aligning two modalities at a time. While some recent methods aim to capture higher-order interactions among multiple modalities, they often overlook or insufficiently preserve pairwise relationships, limiting their effectiveness on single-modality tasks. In this work, we introduce Contrastive Fusion (ConFu), a framework that jointly embeds both individual modalities and their fused combinations into a unified representation space, where modalities and their fused counterparts are aligned. ConFu extends traditional pairwise contrastive objectives with an additional fused-modality contrastive term, encouraging the joint embedding of modality pairs with a third modality. This formulation enables ConFu to capture higher-order dependencies, such as XOR-like relationships, that cannot be recovered through pairwise alignment alone, while still maintaining strong pairwise correspondence. We evaluate ConFu on synthetic and real-world multimodal benchmarks, assessing its ability to exploit cross-modal complementarity, capture higher-order dependencies, and scale with increasing multimodal complexity. Across these settings, ConFu demonstrates competitive performance on retrieval and classification tasks, while supporting unified one-to-one and two-to-one retrieval within a single contrastive framework.

Abstract: This paper presents the SIFT-SNN framework, a low-latency neuromorphic signal-processing pipeline for real-time detection of structural anomalies in transport infrastructure. The proposed approach integrates Scale-Invariant Feature Transform (SIFT) for spatial feature encoding with a latency-driven spike conversion layer and a Leaky Integrate-and-Fire (LIF) Spiking Neural Network (SNN) for classification. The Auckland Harbour Bridge dataset is recorded under various weather and lighting conditions, comprising 6,000 labelled frames that include both real and synthetically augmented unsafe cases. The presented system achieves a classification accuracy of 92.3% (+- 0.8%) with a per-frame inference time of 9.5 ms. Achieved sub-10 millisecond latency, combined with sparse spike activity (8.1%), enables real-time, low-power edge deployment. Unlike conventional CNN-based approaches, the hybrid SIFT-SNN pipeline explicitly preserves spatial feature grounding, enhances interpretability, supports transparent decision-making, and operates efficiently on embedded hardware. Although synthetic augmentation improved robustness, generalisation to unseen field conditions remains to be validated. The SIFT-SNN framework is validated through a working prototype deployed on a consumer-grade system and framed as a generalisable case study in structural safety monitoring for movable concrete barriers, which, as a traffic flow-control infrastructure, is deployed in over 20 cities worldwide.

However, existing surgical datasets predominantly adopt a Visual Question Answering (VQA) format with heterogeneous taxonomies and lack support for pixel-level segmentation, limiting consistent evaluation and applicability. We present SurgMLLMBench, a unified multimodal benchmark explicitly designed for developing and evaluating interactive multimodal LLMs for surgical scene understanding, including the newly collected Micro-surgical Artificial Vascular anastomosIS (MAVIS) dataset. It integrates pixel-level instrument segmentation masks and structured VQA annotations across laparoscopic, robot-assisted, and micro-surgical domains under a unified taxonomy, enabling comprehensive evaluation beyond traditional VQA tasks and richer visual-conversational interactions. Extensive baseline experiments show that a single model trained on SurgMLLMBench achieves consistent performance across domains and generalizes effectively to unseen datasets. SurgMLLMBench will be publicly released as a robust resource to advance multimodal surgical AI research, supporting reproducible evaluation and development of interactive surgical reasoning models.

Abstract: Estimating the normal of a point requires constructing a local patch to provide center-surrounding context, but determining the appropriate neighborhood size is difficult when dealing with different data or geometries. Existing methods commonly employ various parameter-heavy strategies to extract a full feature description from the input patch. However, they still have difficulties in accurately and efficiently predicting normals for various point clouds. In this work, we present a new idea of feature extraction for robust normal estimation of point clouds. We use the fusion of multi-scale features from different neighborhood sizes to address the issue of selecting reasonable patch sizes for various data or geometries. We seek to model a patch feature fitting (PFF) based on multi-scale features to approximate the optimal geometric description for normal estimation and implement the approximation process via multi-scale feature aggregation and cross-scale feature compensation. The feature aggregation module progressively aggregates the patch features of different scales to the center of the patch and shrinks the patch size by removing points far from the center. It not only enables the network to precisely capture the structure characteristic in a wide range, but also describes highly detailed geometries. The feature compensation module ensures the reusability of features from earlier layers of large scales and reveals associated information in different patch sizes. Our approximation strategy based on aggregating the features of multiple scales enables the model to achieve scale adaptation of varying local patches and deliver the optimal feature description. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance on both synthetic and real-world datasets with fewer network parameters and running time.

Abstract: Endoscopic (endo) video exhibits strong view-dependent effects such as specularities, wet reflections, and occlusions. Pure photometric supervision misaligns with geometry and triggers early geometric drift, where erroneous shapes are reinforced during densification and become hard to correct. We ask how to anchor geometry early for 4D Gaussian splatting (4DGS) while maintaining temporal consistency and efficiency in dynamic endoscopic scenes. Thus, we present Endo-G$^{2}$T, a geometry-guided and temporally aware training scheme for time-embedded 4DGS. First, geo-guided prior distillation converts confidence-gated monocular depth into supervision with scale-invariant depth and depth-gradient losses, using a warm-up-to-cap schedule to inject priors softly and avoid early overfitting. Second, a time-embedded Gaussian field represents dynamics in XYZT with a rotor-like rotation parameterization, yielding temporally coherent geometry with lightweight regularization that favors smooth motion and crisp opacity boundaries. Third, keyframe-constrained streaming improves efficiency and long-horizon stability through keyframe-focused optimization under a max-points budget, while non-keyframes advance with lightweight updates. Across EndoNeRF and StereoMIS-P1 datasets, Endo-G$^{2}$T achieves state-of-the-art results among monocular reconstruction baselines.

Abstract: Spatio-temporal video grounding (STVG) requires localizing a target object in untrimmed videos both temporally and spatially from natural language descriptions. Despite their strong language understanding, multimodal large language models (MLLMs) underperform on STVG due to misaligned training objectives and weak fine-grained region-word alignment in standard visual encoders. To address this, we propose STVG-o1, the first framework that enables off-the-shelf MLLMs to achieve state-of-the-art STVG performance without any architectural modifications. Our method introduces a bounding-box chain-of-thought mechanism that explicitly reasons about spatio-temporal locations in an intermediate step before producing the final prediction. We further design a multi-dimensional reinforcement reward function consisting of format, consistency, temporal, spatial, and think rewards, which provides geometry-aware supervision through reinforcement fine-tuning. Evaluated on HCSTVG-v1/v2 and VidSTG, STVG-o1 sets new state-of-the-art results on HCSTVG, outperforming the best task-specific method by 7.3\% m\_tIoU on HCSTVG-v1, matching specialized models on VidSTG, and surpassing all existing MLLM-based approaches by large margins. It also demonstrates strong open-vocabulary generalization across datasets, establishing MLLMs as viable and powerful backbones for precise spatio-temporal grounding. Our code and models will be released.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: "Thinking with images" has emerged as an effective paradigm for advancing visual reasoning, extending beyond text-only chains of thought by injecting visual evidence into intermediate reasoning steps. However, existing methods fall short of human-like abstract visual thinking, as their flexibility is fundamentally limited by external tools. In this work, we introduce Monet, a training framework that enables multimodal large language models (MLLMs) to reason directly within the latent visual space by generating continuous embeddings that function as intermediate visual thoughts. We identify two core challenges in training MLLMs for latent visual reasoning: high computational cost in latent-vision alignment and insufficient supervision over latent embeddings, and address them with a three-stage distillation-based supervised fine-tuning (SFT) pipeline. We further reveal a limitation of applying GRPO to latent reasoning: it primarily enhances text-based reasoning rather than latent reasoning. To overcome this, we propose VLPO (Visual-latent Policy Optimization), a reinforcement learning method that explicitly incorporates latent embeddings into policy gradient updates. To support SFT, we construct Monet-SFT-125K, a high-quality text-image interleaved CoT dataset containing 125K real-world, chart, OCR, and geometry CoTs. Our model, Monet-7B, shows consistent gains across real-world perception and reasoning benchmarks and exhibits strong out-of-distribution generalization on challenging abstract visual reasoning tasks. We also empirically analyze the role of each training component and discuss our early unsuccessful attempts, providing insights for future developments in visual latent reasoning. Our model, data, and code are available at https://github.com/NOVAglow646/Monet.

Abstract: How does irrelevant information (i.e., distractors) affect test-time scaling in vision-language models (VLMs)? Prior studies on language models have reported an inverse scaling effect, where textual distractors lead to longer but less effective reasoning. To investigate whether similar phenomena occur in multimodal settings, we introduce Idis (Images with distractors), a visual question-answering dataset that systematically varies distractors along semantic, numerical, and spatial dimensions. Our analyses reveal that visual distractors differ fundamentally from textual ones: although inverse scaling persists, adding visual distractors reduces accuracy without increasing reasoning length. We further show that tracking attribute counts within reasoning traces provides key insights into how distractors, reasoning length, and accuracy interact. Finally, we demonstrate that these trends extend to established visual bias benchmarks such as Waterbirds, and we propose a simple prompting strategy to mitigate bias-driven predictions in reasoning models.

Abstract: We introduce DiverseVAR, a framework that enhances the diversity of text-conditioned visual autoregressive models (VAR) at test time without requiring retraining, fine-tuning, or substantial computational overhead. While VAR models have recently emerged as strong competitors to diffusion and flow models for image generation, they suffer from a critical limitation in diversity, often producing nearly identical images even for simple prompts. This issue has largely gone unnoticed amid the predominant focus on image quality. We address this limitation at test time in two stages. First, inspired by diversity enhancement techniques in diffusion models, we propose injecting noise into the text embedding. This introduces a trade-off between diversity and image quality: as diversity increases, the image quality sharply declines. To preserve quality, we propose scale-travel: a novel latent refinement technique inspired by time-travel strategies in diffusion models. Specifically, we use a multi-scale autoencoder to extract coarse-scale tokens that enable us to resume generation at intermediate stages. Extensive experiments show that combining text-embedding noise injection with our scale-travel refinement significantly enhances diversity while minimizing image-quality degradation, achieving a new Pareto frontier in the diversity-quality trade-off.

Abstract: Remote sensing change captioning is an emerging and popular research task that aims to describe, in natural language, the content of interest that has changed between two remote sensing images captured at different times. Existing methods typically employ CNNs/Transformers to extract visual representations from the given images or incorporate auxiliary tasks to enhance the final results, with weak region awareness and limited temporal alignment. To address these issues, this paper explores the use of the SAM (Segment Anything Model) foundation model to extract region-level representations and inject region-of-interest knowledge into the captioning framework. Specifically, we employ a CNN/Transformer model to extract global-level vision features, leverage the SAM foundation model to delineate semantic- and motion-level change regions, and utilize a specially constructed knowledge graph to provide information about objects of interest. These heterogeneous sources of information are then fused via cross-attention, and a Transformer decoder is used to generate the final natural language description of the observed changes. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance across multiple widely used benchmark datasets.

Abstract: 3D reassembly is a fundamental geometric problem, and in recent years it has increasingly been challenged by deep learning methods rather than classical optimization. While learning approaches have shown promising results, most still rely primarily on geometric features to assemble a whole from its parts. As a result, methods struggle when geometry alone is insufficient or ambiguous, for example, for small, eroded, or symmetric fragments. Additionally, solutions do not impose physical constraints that explicitly prevent overlapping assemblies. To address these limitations, we introduce E-M3RF, an equivariant multimodal 3D reassembly framework that takes as input the point clouds, containing both point positions and colors of fractured fragments, and predicts the transformations required to reassemble them using SE(3) flow matching. Each fragment is represented by both geometric and color features: i) 3D point positions are encoded as rotationconsistent geometric features using a rotation-equivariant encoder, ii) the colors at each 3D point are encoded with a transformer. The two feature sets are then combined to form a multimodal representation. We experimented on four datasets: two synthetic datasets, Breaking Bad and Fantastic Breaks, and two real-world cultural heritage datasets, RePAIR and Presious, demonstrating that E-M3RF on the RePAIR dataset reduces rotation error by 23.1% and translation error by 13.2%, while Chamfer Distance decreases by 18.4% compared to competing methods.

Abstract: We present a novel unsupervised framework to unlock vast unlabeled human demonstration data from continuous industrial video streams for Vision-Language-Action (VLA) model pre-training. Our method first trains a lightweight motion tokenizer to encode motion dynamics, then employs an unsupervised action segmenter leveraging a novel "Latent Action Energy" metric to discover and segment semantically coherent action primitives. The pipeline outputs both segmented video clips and their corresponding latent action sequences, providing structured data directly suitable for VLA pre-training. Evaluations on public benchmarks and a proprietary electric motor assembly dataset demonstrate effective segmentation of key tasks performed by humans at workstations. Further clustering and quantitative assessment via a Vision-Language Model confirm the semantic coherence of the discovered action primitives. To our knowledge, this is the first fully automated end-to-end system for extracting and organizing VLA pre-training data from unstructured industrial videos, offering a scalable solution for embodied AI integration in manufacturing.

Abstract: Event cameras produce asynchronous event streams that are spatially sparse yet temporally dense. Mainstream event representation learning algorithms typically use event frames, voxels, or tensors as input. Although these approaches have achieved notable progress, they struggle to address the undersampling problem caused by spatial sparsity. In this paper, we propose a novel hypergraph-guided spatio-temporal event stream completion mechanism, which connects event tokens across different times and spatial locations via hypergraphs and leverages contextual information message passing to complete these sparse events. The proposed method can flexibly incorporate RGB tokens as nodes in the hypergraph within this completion framework, enabling multi-modal hypergraph-based information completion. Subsequently, we aggregate hypergraph node information across different time steps through self-attention, enabling effective learning and fusion of multi-modal features. Extensive experiments on both single- and multi-label event classification tasks fully validated the effectiveness of our proposed framework. The source code of this paper will be released on https://github.com/Event-AHU/EvRainDrop.

Abstract: Recently, video generation has witnessed rapid advancements, drawing increasing attention to image-to-video (I2V) synthesis on mobile devices. However, the substantial computational complexity and slow generation speed of diffusion models pose significant challenges for real-time, high-resolution video generation on resource-constrained mobile devices. In this work, we propose MobileI2V, a 270M lightweight diffusion model for real-time image-to-video generation on mobile devices. The core lies in: (1) We analyzed the performance of linear attention modules and softmax attention modules on mobile devices, and proposed a linear hybrid architecture denoiser that balances generation efficiency and quality. (2) We design a time-step distillation strategy that compresses the I2V sampling steps from more than 20 to only two without significant quality loss, resulting in a 10-fold increase in generation speed. (3) We apply mobile-specific attention optimizations that yield a 2-fold speed-up for attention operations during on-device inference. MobileI2V enables, for the first time, fast 720p image-to-video generation on mobile devices, with quality comparable to existing models. Under one-step conditions, the generation speed of each frame of 720p video is less than 100 ms. Our code is available at: https://github.com/hustvl/MobileI2V.

Abstract: Vision Transformers have demonstrated exceptional performance across various computer vision tasks, yet their quadratic computational complexity concerning token length remains a significant challenge. To address this, token reduction methods have been widely explored. However, existing approaches often overlook the frequency characteristics of self-attention, such as rank collapsing and over-smoothing phenomenon. In this paper, we propose a frequency-aware token reduction strategy that improves computational efficiency while preserving performance by mitigating rank collapsing. Our method partitions tokens into high-frequency tokens and low-frequency tokens. high-frequency tokens are selectively preserved, while low-frequency tokens are aggregated into a compact direct current token to retain essential low-frequency components. Through extensive experiments and analysis, we demonstrate that our approach significantly improves accuracy while reducing computational overhead and mitigating rank collapsing and over smoothing. Furthermore, we analyze the previous methods, shedding light on their implicit frequency characteristics and limitations.

Abstract: We present a novel training approach, named Merge-and-Bound (M&B) for Class Incremental Learning (CIL), which directly manipulates model weights in the parameter space for optimization. Our algorithm involves two types of weight merging: inter-task weight merging and intra-task weight merging. Inter-task weight merging unifies previous models by averaging the weights of models from all previous stages. On the other hand, intra-task weight merging facilitates the learning of current task by combining the model parameters within current stage. For reliable weight merging, we also propose a bounded update technique that aims to optimize the target model with minimal cumulative updates and preserve knowledge from previous tasks; this strategy reveals that it is possible to effectively obtain new models near old ones, reducing catastrophic forgetting. M&B is seamlessly integrated into existing CIL methods without modifying architecture components or revising learning objectives. We extensively evaluate our algorithm on standard CIL benchmarks and demonstrate superior performance compared to state-of-the-art methods.

Abstract: We propose Cross-Attention-based Non-local Knowledge Distillation (CanKD), a novel feature-based knowledge distillation framework that leverages cross-attention mechanisms to enhance the knowledge transfer process. Unlike traditional self-attention-based distillation methods that align teacher and student feature maps independently, CanKD enables each pixel in the student feature map to dynamically consider all pixels in the teacher feature map. This non-local knowledge transfer more thoroughly captures pixel-wise relationships, improving feature representation learning. Our method introduces only an additional loss function to achieve superior performance compared with existing attention-guided distillation methods. Extensive experiments on object detection and image segmentation tasks demonstrate that CanKD outperforms state-of-the-art feature and hybrid distillation methods. These experimental results highlight CanKD's potential as a new paradigm for attention-guided distillation in computer vision tasks. Code is available at https://github.com/tori-hotaru/CanKD

Abstract: The effectiveness of deepfake detection methods often depends less on their core design and more on implementation details such as data preprocessing, augmentation strategies, and optimization techniques. These factors make it difficult to fairly compare detectors and to understand which factors truly contribute to their performance. To address this, we systematically investigate how different design choices influence the accuracy and generalization capabilities of deepfake detection models, focusing on aspects related to training, inference, and incremental updates. By isolating the impact of individual factors, we aim to establish robust, architecture-agnostic best practices for the design and development of future deepfake detection systems. Our experiments identify a set of design choices that consistently improve deepfake detection and enable state-of-the-art performance on the AI-GenBench benchmark.

Abstract: Antinuclear antibody (ANA) testing is a crucial method for diagnosing autoimmune disorders, including lupus, Sjögren's syndrome, and scleroderma. Despite its importance, manual ANA detection is slow, labor-intensive, and demands years of training. ANA detection is complicated by over 100 coexisting antibody types, resulting in vast fluorescent pattern combinations. Although machine learning and deep learning have enabled automation, ANA detection in real-world clinical settings presents unique challenges as it involves multi-instance, multi-label (MIML) learning. In this paper, a novel framework for ANA detection is proposed that handles the complexities of MIML tasks using unaltered microscope images without manual preprocessing. Inspired by human labeling logic, it identifies consistent ANA sub-regions and assigns aggregated labels accordingly. These steps are implemented using three task-specific components: an instance sampler, a probabilistic pseudo-label dispatcher, and self-paced weight learning rate coefficients. The instance sampler suppresses low-confidence instances by modeling pattern confidence, while the dispatcher adaptively assigns labels based on instance distinguishability. Self-paced learning adjusts training according to empirical label observations. Our framework overcomes limitations of traditional MIML methods and supports end-to-end optimization. Extensive experiments on one ANA dataset and three public medical MIML benchmarks demonstrate the superiority of our framework. On the ANA dataset, our model achieves up to +7.0% F1-Macro and +12.6% mAP gains over the best prior method, setting new state-of-the-art results. It also ranks top-2 across all key metrics on public datasets, reducing Hamming loss and one-error by up to 18.2% and 26.9%, respectively.

Abstract: Recent advances in foundation models have shown great promise in domains such as natural language processing and computer vision, and similar efforts are now emerging in the Earth Observation community. These models aim to generalize across tasks with limited supervision, reducing the need for training separate models for each task. However, current strategies, which largely focus on scaling model size and dataset volume, require prohibitive computational and data resources, limiting accessibility to only a few large institutions. Moreover, this paradigm of ever-larger models stands in stark contrast with the principles of sustainable and environmentally responsible AI, as it leads to immense carbon footprints and resource inefficiency. In this work, we present a novel and efficient alternative: an Ensemble-of-Specialists framework for building Remote Sensing Foundation Models (RSFMs). Our method decomposes the training process into lightweight, task-specific ConvNeXtV2 specialists that can be frozen and reused. This modular approach offers strong advantages in efficiency, interpretability, and extensibility. Moreover, it naturally supports federated training, pruning, and continuous specialist integration, making it particularly well-suited for collaborative and resource-constrained settings. Our framework sets a new direction for building scalable and efficient RSFMs.

Abstract: Alzheimer's disease is a debilitating disorder marked by a decline in cognitive function. Timely identification of the disease is essential for the development of personalized treatment strategies that aim to mitigate its progression. The application of generated images for the prediction of Alzheimer's disease poses challenges, particularly in accurately representing the disease's characteristics when input sequences are captured at irregular time intervals. This study presents an innovative methodology for sequential image generation, guided by quantitative metrics, to maintain the essential features indicative of disease progression. Furthermore, an age-scaling factor is integrated into the process to produce age-specific MRI images, facilitating the prediction of advanced stages of the disease. The results obtained from the ablation study suggest that the inclusion of quantitative metrics significantly improves the accuracy of MRI image synthesis. Furthermore, the application of age-scaled pixel loss contributed to the enhanced iterative generation of MRI images. In terms of long-term disease prognosis, the Structural Similarity Index reached a peak value of 0.882, indicating a substantial degree of similarity in the synthesized images.

Abstract: Reward feedback learning (ReFL) has proven effective for aligning image generation with human preferences. However, its extension to video generation faces significant challenges. Existing video reward models rely on vision-language models designed for pixel-space inputs, confining ReFL optimization to near-complete denoising steps after computationally expensive VAE decoding. This pixel-space approach incurs substantial memory overhead and increased training time, and its late-stage optimization lacks early-stage supervision, refining only visual quality rather than fundamental motion dynamics and structural coherence. In this work, we show that pre-trained video generation models are naturally suited for reward modeling in the noisy latent space, as they are explicitly designed to process noisy latent representations at arbitrary timesteps and inherently preserve temporal information through their sequential modeling capabilities. Accordingly, we propose Process Reward Feedback Learning~(PRFL), a framework that conducts preference optimization entirely in latent space, enabling efficient gradient backpropagation throughout the full denoising chain without VAE decoding. Extensive experiments demonstrate that PRFL significantly improves alignment with human preferences, while achieving substantial reductions in memory consumption and training time compared to RGB ReFL.

Abstract: Illumination inconsistency is a fundamental challenge in multi-view 3D reconstruction. Variations in sunlight direction, cloud cover, and shadows break the constant-lighting assumption underlying both classical multi-view stereo (MVS) and structure from motion (SfM) pipelines and recent neural rendering methods, leading to geometry drift, color inconsistency, and shadow imprinting. This issue is especially critical in UAV-based reconstruction, where long flight durations and outdoor environments make lighting changes unavoidable. However, existing datasets either restrict capture to short time windows, thus lacking meaningful illumination diversity, or span months and seasons, where geometric and semantic changes confound the isolated study of lighting robustness. We introduce UAVLight, a controlled-yet-real benchmark for illumination-robust 3D reconstruction. Each scene is captured along repeatable, geo-referenced flight paths at multiple fixed times of day, producing natural lighting variation under consistent geometry, calibration, and viewpoints. With standardized evaluation protocols across lighting conditions, UAVLight provides a reliable foundation for developing and benchmarking reconstruction methods that are consistent, faithful, and relightable in real outdoor environments.

Abstract: Adversarial attacks pose a significant threat to learning-based 3D point cloud models, critically undermining their reliability in security-sensitive applications. Existing defense methods often suffer from (1) high computational overhead and (2) poor generalization ability across diverse attack types. To bridge these gaps, we propose a novel yet efficient teacher-student framework, namely Multimodal Robust Prompt Distillation (MRPD) for distilling robust 3D point cloud model. It learns lightweight prompts by aligning student point cloud model's features with robust embeddings from three distinct teachers: a vision model processing depth projections, a high-performance 3D model, and a text encoder. To ensure a reliable knowledge transfer, this distillation is guided by a confidence-gated mechanism which dynamically balances the contribution of all input modalities. Notably, since the distillation is all during the training stage, there is no additional computational cost at inference. Extensive experiments demonstrate that MRPD substantially outperforms state-of-the-art defense methods against a wide range of white-box and black-box attacks, while even achieving better performance on clean data. Our work presents a new, practical paradigm for building robust 3D vision systems by efficiently harnessing multimodal knowledge.

Abstract: Automated landmark detection offers an efficient approach for medical professionals to understand patient anatomic structure and positioning using intra-operative imaging. While current detection methods for pelvic fluoroscopy demonstrate promising accuracy, most assume a fixed Antero-Posterior view of the pelvis. However, orientation often deviates from this standard view, either due to repositioning of the imaging unit or of the target structure itself. To address this limitation, we propose a novel framework that incorporates 2D/3D landmark registration into the training of a U-Net landmark prediction model. We analyze the performance difference by comparing landmark detection accuracy between the baseline U-Net, U-Net trained with Pose Estimation Loss, and U-Net fine-tuned with Pose Estimation Loss under realistic intra-operative conditions where patient pose is variable.

Abstract: The synthesis of synchronized audio-visual content is a key challenge in generative AI, with open-source models facing challenges in robust audio-video alignment. Our analysis reveals that this issue is rooted in three fundamental challenges of the joint diffusion process: (1) Correspondence Drift, where concurrently evolving noisy latents impede stable learning of alignment; (2) inefficient global attention mechanisms that fail to capture fine-grained temporal cues; and (3) the intra-modal bias of conventional Classifier-Free Guidance (CFG), which enhances conditionality but not cross-modal synchronization. To overcome these challenges, we introduce Harmony, a novel framework that mechanistically enforces audio-visual synchronization. We first propose a Cross-Task Synergy training paradigm to mitigate drift by leveraging strong supervisory signals from audio-driven video and video-driven audio generation tasks. Then, we design a Global-Local Decoupled Interaction Module for efficient and precise temporal-style alignment. Finally, we present a novel Synchronization-Enhanced CFG (SyncCFG) that explicitly isolates and amplifies the alignment signal during inference. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Harmony establishes a new state-of-the-art, significantly outperforming existing methods in both generation fidelity and, critically, in achieving fine-grained audio-visual synchronization.

Abstract: Oral cancer is highly common across the globe and is mostly diagnosed during the later stages due to the close visual similarity to benign, precancerous, and malignant lesions in the oral cavity. Implementing computer aided diagnosis systems early on has the potential to greatly improve clinical outcomes. This research intends to use deep learning to build a multiclass classifier for sixteen different oral lesions. To overcome the challenges of limited and imbalanced datasets, the proposed technique combines stratified data splitting and advanced data augmentation and oversampling to perform the classification. The experimental results, which achieved 83.33 percent accuracy, 89.12 percent precision, and 77.31 percent recall, demonstrate the superiority of the suggested model over state of the art methods now in use. The suggested model effectively conveys the effectiveness of oversampling and augmentation strategies in situations where the minority class classification performance is noteworthy. As a first step toward trustworthy computer aided diagnostic systems for the early detection of oral cancer in clinical settings, the suggested framework shows promise.

Abstract: The main determinants of Earth's absolute surface Temperature, T, are the solar constant, S, the Bond albedo, A, and the effective emissivity for thermal radiation, e. In this note we assume that the value of the effective emissivity, e = e(C), is determined by the atmospheric concentration C of CO2. We show that the solar constant is most important, the albedo is second, and the CO2 concentration is a distant third.

Abstract: Coupled atmosphere-ocean deep learning (DL) climate emulators are a new frontier but are known to exhibit weak ENSO variability, raising questions about their ability to simulate teleconnections. Here, we present the first Pacific pacemaker (PACE) experiments using a coupled DL emulator (DLESyM) to bypass this weak variability and isolate the atmospheric response to observed ENSO forcing. We find that while the emulator realistically captures internal atmospheric variability, it produces a significantly amplified forced teleconnection response to ENSO. This amplified response leads to biases in simulating extremes, notably an overestimation of atmospheric blocking frequency and duration with the underestimation of peak intensity. Our findings underscore that coupled DL climate models require in-depth and physically-grounded validation, analogous to traditional numerical models, to build confidence in their use for physical climate analysis.

Abstract: Subgrid machine-learning (ML) parameterizations have the potential to introduce a new generation of climate models that incorporate the effects of higher-resolution physics without incurring the prohibitive computational cost associated with more explicit physics-based simulations. However, important issues, ranging from online instability to inconsistent online performance, have limited their operational use for long-term climate projections. To more rapidly drive progress in solving these issues, domain scientists and machine learning researchers opened up the offline aspect of this problem to the broader machine learning and data science community with the release of ClimSim, a NeurIPS Datasets and Benchmarks publication, and an associated Kaggle competition. This paper reports on the downstream results of the Kaggle competition by coupling emulators inspired by the winning teams' architectures to an interactive climate model (including full cloud microphysics, a regime historically prone to online instability) and systematically evaluating their online performance. Our results demonstrate that online stability in the low-resolution, real-geography setting is reproducible across multiple diverse architectures, which we consider a key milestone. All tested architectures exhibit strikingly similar offline and online biases, though their responses to architecture-agnostic design choices (e.g., expanding the list of input variables) can differ significantly. Multiple Kaggle-inspired architectures achieve state-of-the-art (SOTA) results on certain metrics such as zonal mean bias patterns and global RMSE, indicating that crowdsourcing the essence of the offline problem is one path to improving online performance in hybrid physics-AI climate simulation.

Abstract: Due to the significant variability in electroencephalogram (EEG) signals across individuals, knowledge acquired from previous subjects is often overwritten as new subjects are introduced in continual EEG decoding task. Current works mainly rely on storing the historical data of seen subjects as a replay buffer to prevent forgetting. However, privacy concerns or memory constraints make keeping such data impractical. Instead, we propose a Prototype-guided Non-Exemplar Continual Learning (ProNECL)framework that preserves prior knowledge without accessing any historical EEG samples. ProNECL constructs class-level prototypes to summarize discriminative representations from each subject and incrementally aligns new feature spaces with the global prototype memory through cross-subject feature alignment and knowledge distillation. Validated on the BCI Competition IV 2a and 2b datasets, our framework effectively balances knowledge retention and adaptability, achieving superior performance in cross-subject continual EEG decoding tasks.

Abstract: Associative memory models based on Hopfield networks and self-attention based on key-value mechanisms have been popular approaches in the study of memory mechanisms in deep learning. It has been pointed out that the state update rule of the modern Hopfield network (MHN) in the adiabatic approximation is in agreement with the self-attention layer of Transformer. In this paper, we go beyond this approximation and investigate the relationship between MHN and self-attention. Our results show that the correspondence between Hopfield networks and Transformers can be established in a more generalized form by adding a new variable, the hidden state derived from the MHN, to self-attention. This new attention mechanism, modern Hopfield attention (MHA), allows the inheritance of attention scores from the input layer of the Transformer to the output layer, which greatly improves the nature of attention weights. In particular, we show both theoretically and empirically that MHA hidden states significantly improve serious problem of deep Transformers known as rank collapse and token uniformity. We also confirm that MHA can systematically improve accuracy without adding training parameters to the Vision Transformer or GPT. Our results provide a new case in which Hopfield networks can be a useful perspective for improving the Transformer architecture.

Abstract: Model pruning is a widely adopted technique to reduce the computational complexity and memory footprint of Deep Neural Networks (DNNs). However, global unstructured pruning often leads to significant degradation in accuracy, typically necessitating fine-tuning on the original training dataset to recover performance. In privacy-sensitive domains such as healthcare or finance, access to the original training data is often restricted post-deployment due to regulations (e.g., GDPR, HIPAA). This paper proposes a Data-Free Knowledge Distillation framework to bridge the gap between model compression and data privacy. We utilize DeepInversion to synthesize privacy-preserving ``dream'' images from the pre-trained teacher model by inverting Batch Normalization (BN) statistics. These synthetic images serve as a transfer set to distill knowledge from the original teacher to the pruned student network. Experimental results on CIFAR-10 across various architectures (ResNet, MobileNet, VGG) demonstrate that our method significantly recovers accuracy lost during pruning without accessing a single real data point.

Abstract: Early and accurate detection of Alzheimer's disease (AD) is crucial for enabling timely intervention and improving outcomes. However, developing reliable machine learning (ML) models for AD diagnosis is challenging due to limited labeled data, multi-site heterogeneity, and class imbalance. We propose a Transformer-based diagnostic framework that combines diffusion-based synthetic data generation with graph representation learning and transfer learning. A class-conditional denoising diffusion probabilistic model (DDPM) is trained on the real-world NACC dataset to generate a large synthetic cohort that mirrors multimodal clinical and neuroimaging feature distributions while balancing diagnostic classes. Modality-specific Graph Transformer encoders are first pretrained on this synthetic data to learn robust, class-discriminative representations and are then frozen while a neural classifier is trained on embeddings from the original NACC data. We quantify distributional alignment between real and synthetic cohorts using metrics such as Maximum Mean Discrepancy (MMD), Frechet distance, and energy distance, and complement discrimination metrics with calibration and fixed-specificity sensitivity analyses. Empirically, our framework outperforms standard baselines, including early and late fusion deep neural networks and the multimodal graph-based model MaGNet, yielding higher AUC, accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity under subject-wise cross-validation on NACC. These results show that diffusion-based synthetic pretraining with Graph Transformers can improve generalization in low-sample, imbalanced clinical prediction settings.

Abstract: Inverse problems are fundamental to science and engineering, where the goal is to infer an underlying signal or state from incomplete or noisy measurements. Recent approaches employ diffusion models as powerful implicit priors for such problems, owing to their ability to capture complex data distributions. However, existing diffusion-based methods for inverse problems often rely on strong approximations of the posterior distribution, require computationally expensive gradient backpropagation through the score network, or are restricted to linear measurement models.
  In this work, we propose Restart for Posterior Sampling (RePS), a general and efficient framework for solving both linear and non-linear inverse problems using pre-trained diffusion models. RePS builds on the idea of restart-based sampling, previously shown to improve sample quality in unconditional diffusion, and extends it to posterior inference. Our method employs a conditioned ODE applicable to any differentiable measurement model and introduces a simplified restart strategy that contracts accumulated approximation errors during sampling. Unlike some of the prior approaches, RePS avoids backpropagation through the score network, substantially reducing computational cost.
  We demonstrate that RePS achieves faster convergence and superior reconstruction quality compared to existing diffusion-based baselines across a range of inverse problems, including both linear and non-linear settings.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) often exhibit systematic errors on specific subsets of data, known as error slices. For instance, a slice can correspond to a certain demographic, where a model does poorly in identifying toxic comments regarding that demographic. Identifying error slices is crucial to understanding and improving models, but it is also challenging. An appealing approach to reduce the amount of manual annotation required is to actively group errors that are likely to belong to the same slice, while using limited access to an annotator to verify whether the chosen samples share the same pattern of model mistake. In this paper, we formalize this approach as Active Slice Discovery and explore it empirically on a problem of discovering human-defined slices in toxicity classification. We examine the efficacy of active slice discovery under different choices of feature representations and active learning algorithms. On several slices, we find that uncertainty-based active learning algorithms are most effective, achieving competitive accuracy using 2-10% of the available slice membership information, while significantly outperforming baselines.

Abstract: PPO has been widely adopted for training large language models (LLMs) at the token level in multi-turn dialogue and reasoning tasks. However, its performance is often unstable and prone to collapse. Through empirical analysis, we identify two main sources of instability in this setting: (1)~token-level importance sampling, which is misaligned with the natural granularity of multi-turn environments that have distinct turn-level stages, and (2) inaccurate advantage estimates from off-policy samples, where the critic has not learned to evaluate certain state-action pairs, resulting in high-variance gradients and unstable updates. To address these challenges, we introduce two complementary stabilization techniques: (1) turn-level importance sampling, which aligns optimization with the natural structure of multi-turn reasoning, and (2) clipping-bias correction, which normalizes gradients by downweighting unreliable, highly off-policy samples. Depending on how these components are combined, we obtain three variants: Turn-PPO (turn-level sampling only), S-PPO (clipping-bias correction applied to token-level PPO), and ST-PPO (turn-level sampling combined with clipping-bias correction). In our experiments, we primarily study ST-PPO and S-PPO, which together demonstrate how the two stabilization mechanisms address complementary sources of instability. Experiments on multi-turn search tasks across general QA, multi-hop QA, and medical multiple-choice QA benchmarks show that ST-PPO and S-PPO consistently prevent the performance collapses observed in large-model training, maintain lower clipping ratios throughout optimization, and achieve higher task performance than standard token-level PPO. These results demonstrate that combining turn-level importance sampling with clipping-bias correction provides a practical and scalable solution for stabilizing multi-turn LLM agent training.

Abstract: Foundation models (FMs) have emerged as a powerful paradigm, enabling a diverse range of data analytics and knowledge discovery tasks across scientific fields. Inspired by the success of FMs, particularly large language models, researchers have recently begun to explore spatio-temporal foundation models (STFMs) to improve adaptability and generalization across a wide spectrum of spatio-temporal (ST) tasks. Despite rapid progress, a systematic investigation of trajectory foundation models (TFMs), a crucial subclass of STFMs, is largely lacking. This tutorial addresses this gap by offering a comprehensive overview of recent advances in TFMs, including a taxonomy of existing methodologies and a critical analysis of their strengths and limitations. In addition, the tutorial highlights open challenges and outlines promising research directions to advance spatio-temporal general intelligence through the development of robust, responsible, and transferable TFMs.

Abstract: Globally interpretable models are a promising approach for trustworthy AI in safety-critical domains. Alongside global explanations, detailed local explanations are a crucial complement to effectively support human experts during inference. This work proposes the Calibrated Hierarchical QPM (CHiQPM) which offers uniquely comprehensive global and local interpretability, paving the way for human-AI complementarity. CHiQPM achieves superior global interpretability by contrastively explaining the majority of classes and offers novel hierarchical explanations that are more similar to how humans reason and can be traversed to offer a built-in interpretable Conformal prediction (CP) method. Our comprehensive evaluation shows that CHiQPM achieves state-of-the-art accuracy as a point predictor, maintaining 99% accuracy of non-interpretable models. This demonstrates a substantial improvement, where interpretability is incorporated without sacrificing overall accuracy. Furthermore, its calibrated set prediction is competitively efficient to other CP methods, while providing interpretable predictions of coherent sets along its hierarchical explanation.

Abstract: Recent advances in mechanistic interpretability have revealed that large language models (LLMs) develop internal representations corresponding not only to concrete entities but also distinct, human-understandable abstract concepts and behaviour. Moreover, these hidden features can be directly manipulated to steer model behaviour. However, it remains an open question whether this phenomenon is unique to models trained on inherently structured data (ie. language, images) or if it is a general property of foundation models. In this work, we investigate the internal representations of a large physics-focused foundation model. Inspired by recent work identifying single directions in activation space for complex behaviours in LLMs, we extract activation vectors from the model during forward passes over simulation datasets for different physical regimes. We then compute "delta" representations between the two regimes. These delta tensors act as concept directions in activation space, encoding specific physical features. By injecting these concept directions back into the model during inference, we can steer its predictions, demonstrating causal control over physical behaviours, such as inducing or removing some particular physical feature from a simulation. These results suggest that scientific foundation models learn generalised representations of physical principles. They do not merely rely on superficial correlations and patterns in the simulations. Our findings open new avenues for understanding and controlling scientific foundation models and has implications for AI-enabled scientific discovery.

Abstract: We develop a data-driven approach for runtime safety monitoring in flight testing, where pilots perform maneuvers on aircraft with uncertain parameters. Because safety violations can arise unexpectedly as a result of these uncertainties, pilots need clear, preemptive criteria to abort the maneuver in advance of safety violation. To solve this problem, we use offline stochastic trajectory simulation to learn a calibrated statistical model of the short-term safety risk facing pilots. We use flight testing as a motivating example for data-driven learning/monitoring of safety due to its inherent safety risk, uncertainty, and human-interaction. However, our approach consists of three broadly-applicable components: a model to predict future state from recent observations, a nearest neighbor model to classify the safety of the predicted state, and classifier calibration via conformal prediction. We evaluate our method on a flight dynamics model with uncertain parameters, demonstrating its ability to reliably identify unsafe scenarios, match theoretical guarantees, and outperform baseline approaches in preemptive classification of risk.

Abstract: Untrained large neural networks, just after random initialization, tend to favour a small subset of classes, assigning high predicted probabilities to these few classes and approximately zero probability to all others. This bias, termed Initial Guessing Bias, affects the early training dynamics, when the model is fitting to the coarse structure of the data. The choice of loss function against which to train the model has a large impact on how these early dynamics play out. Two recent loss functions, Blurry and Piecewise-zero loss, were designed for robustness to label errors but can become unable to steer the direction of training when exposed to this initial bias. Results indicate that the choice of loss function has a dramatic effect on the early phase training of networks, and highlights the need for careful consideration of how Initial Guessing Bias may interact with various components of the training scheme.

Abstract: The solar wind, a continuous outflow of charged particles from the Sun's corona, shapes the heliosphere and impacts space systems near Earth. Accurate prediction of features such as high-speed streams and coronal mass ejections is critical for space weather forecasting, but traditional three-dimensional magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) models are computationally expensive, limiting rapid exploration of boundary condition uncertainties. We introduce the first autoregressive machine learning surrogate for steady-state solar wind radial velocity using the Spherical Fourier Neural Operator (SFNO). By predicting a limited radial range and iteratively propagating the solution outward, the model improves accuracy in distant regions compared to a single-step approach. Compared with the numerical HUX surrogate, SFNO demonstrates superior or comparable performance while providing a flexible, trainable, and data-driven alternative, establishing a novel methodology for high-fidelity solar wind modeling. The source code and additional visual results are available at https://github.com/rezmansouri/solarwind-sfno-velocity-autoregressive.

Abstract: We present Primal, a deterministic feature mapping framework that harnesses the number-theoretic independence of prime square roots to construct robust, tunable vector representations. Diverging from standard stochastic projections (e.g., Random Fourier Features), our method exploits the Besicovitch property to create irrational frequency modulations that guarantee infinite non-repeating phase trajectories. We formalize two distinct algorithmic variants: (1) StaticPrime, a sequence generation method that produces temporal position encodings empirically approaching the theoretical Welch bound for quasi-orthogonality; and (2) DynamicPrime, a tunable projection layer for input-dependent feature mapping. A central novelty of the dynamic framework is its ability to unify two disparate mathematical utility classes through a single scaling parameter σ. In the low-frequency regime, the method acts as an isometric kernel map, effectively linearizing non-convex geometries (e.g., spirals) to enable high-fidelity signal reconstruction and compressive sensing. Conversely, the high-frequency regime induces chaotic phase wrapping, transforming the projection into a maximum-entropy one-way hash suitable for Hyperdimensional Computing and privacy-preserving Split Learning. Empirical evaluations demonstrate that our framework yields superior orthogonality retention and distribution tightness compared to normalized Gaussian baselines, establishing it as a computationally efficient, mathematically rigorous alternative to random matrix projections.

Abstract: Training deep networks with noisy labels leads to poor generalization and degraded accuracy due to overfitting to label noise. Existing approaches for learning with noisy labels often rely on the availability of a clean subset of data. By pre-training a feature extractor backbone without labels using self-supervised learning (SSL), followed by standard supervised training on the noisy dataset, we can train a more noise robust model without requiring a subset with clean labels. We evaluate the use of SimCLR and Barlow~Twins as SSL methods on CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100 under synthetic and real world noise. Across all noise rates, self-supervised pre-training consistently improves classification accuracy and enhances downstream label-error detection (F1 and Balanced Accuracy). The performance gap widens as the noise rate increases, demonstrating improved robustness. Notably, our approach achieves comparable results to ImageNet pre-trained models at low noise levels, while substantially outperforming them under high noise conditions.

Abstract: State resetting is a fundamental but often overlooked capability of simulators. It supports sample-based planning by allowing resets to previously encountered simulation states, and enables calibration of simulators using real data by resetting to states observed in real-system traces. While often taken for granted, state resetting in complex simulators can be nontrivial: when the simulator comes with latent variables (states), state resetting requires sampling from the posterior over the latent state given the observable history, a.k.a. the belief state (Silver and Veness, 2010). While exact sampling is often infeasible, many approximate belief-state samplers can be constructed, raising the question of how to select among them using only sampling access to the simulator.
  In this paper, we show that this problem reduces to a general conditional distribution-selection task and develop a new algorithm and analysis under sampling-only access. Building on this reduction, the belief-state selection problem admits two different formulations: latent state-based selection, which directly targets the conditional distribution of the latent state, and observation-based selection, which targets the induced distribution over the observation. Interestingly, these formulations differ in how their guarantees interact with the downstream roll-out methods: perhaps surprisingly, observation-based selection may fail under the most natural roll-out method (which we call Single-Reset) but enjoys guarantees under the less conventional alternative (which we call Repeated-Reset). Together with discussion on issues such as distribution shift and the choice of sampling policies, our paper reveals a rich landscape of algorithmic choices, theoretical nuances, and open questions, in this seemingly simple problem.

Abstract: Real-world systems ranging from airline routes to cryptocurrency transfers are naturally modelled as dynamic graphs whose topology changes over time. Conventional benchmarks judge dynamic-graph learners by a handful of task-specific scores, yet seldom ask whether the embeddings themselves remain a truthful, interpretable reflection of the evolving network. We formalize this requirement as representation integrity and derive a family of indexes that measure how closely embedding changes follow graph changes. Three synthetic scenarios, Gradual Merge, Abrupt Move, and Periodic Re-wiring, are used to screen forty-two candidate indexes. Based on which we recommend one index that passes all of our theoretical and empirical tests. In particular, this validated metric consistently ranks the provably stable UASE and IPP models highest. We then use this index to do a comparative study on representation integrity of common dynamic graph learning models. This study exposes the scenario-specific strengths of neural methods, and shows a strong positive rank correlation with one-step link-prediction AUC. The proposed integrity framework, therefore, offers a task-agnostic and interpretable evaluation tool for dynamic-graph representation quality, providing more explicit guidance for model selection and future architecture design.

Abstract: We study streaming data with categorical features where the vocabulary of categorical feature values is changing and can even grow unboundedly over time. Feature hashing is commonly used as a pre-processing step to map these categorical values into a feature space of fixed size before learning their embeddings. While these methods have been developed and evaluated for offline or batch settings, in this paper we consider online settings. We show that deterministic embeddings are sensitive to the arrival order of categories and suffer from forgetting in online learning, leading to performance deterioration. To mitigate this issue, we propose a probabilistic hash embedding (PHE) model that treats hash embeddings as stochastic and applies Bayesian online learning to learn incrementally from data. Based on the structure of PHE, we derive a scalable inference algorithm to learn model parameters and infer/update the posteriors of hash embeddings and other latent variables. Our algorithm (i) can handle an evolving vocabulary of categorical items, (ii) is adaptive to new items without forgetting old items, (iii) is implementable with a bounded set of parameters that does not grow with the number of distinct observed values on the stream, and (iv) is invariant to the item arrival order. Experiments in classification, sequence modeling, and recommendation systems in online learning setups demonstrate the superior performance of PHE while maintaining high memory efficiency (consumes as low as 2~4 memory of a one-hot embedding table).

Abstract: Machine learning models trained on real-world data may inadvertently make biased predictions that negatively impact marginalized communities. Reweighting is a method that can mitigate such bias in model predictions by assigning a weight to each data point used during model training. In this paper, we compare three methods for generating these weights: (1) evolving them using a Genetic Algorithm (GA), (2) computing them using only dataset characteristics, and (3) assigning equal weights to all data points. Model performance under each strategy was evaluated using paired predictive and fairness metrics, which also served as optimization objectives for the GA during evolution. Specifically, we used two predictive metrics (accuracy and area under the Receiver Operating Characteristic curve) and two fairness metrics (demographic parity difference and subgroup false negative fairness). Using experiments on eleven publicly available datasets (including two medical datasets), we show that evolved sample weights can produce models that achieve better trade-offs between fairness and predictive performance than alternative weighting methods. However, the magnitude of these benefits depends strongly on the choice of optimization objectives. Our experiments reveal that optimizing with accuracy and demographic parity difference metrics yields the largest number of datasets for which evolved weights are significantly better than other weighting strategies in optimizing both objectives.

Abstract: Existing studies on reinforcement learning (RL) for sepsis management have mostly followed an established problem setup, in which patient data are aggregated into 4-hour time steps. Although concerns have been raised regarding the coarseness of this time-step size, which might distort patient dynamics and lead to suboptimal treatment policies, the extent to which this is a problem in practice remains unexplored. In this work, we conducted empirical experiments for a controlled comparison of four time-step sizes ($Δt\!=\!1,2,4,8$ h) on this domain, following an identical offline RL pipeline. To enable a fair comparison across time-step sizes, we designed action re-mapping methods that allow for evaluation of policies on datasets with different time-step sizes, and conducted cross-$Δt$ model selections under two policy learning setups. Our goal was to quantify how time-step size influences state representation learning, behavior cloning, policy training, and off-policy evaluation. Our results show that performance trends across $Δt$ vary as learning setups change, while policies learned at finer time-step sizes ($Δt = 1$ h and $2$ h) using a static behavior policy achieve the overall best performance and stability. Our work highlights time-step size as a core design choice in offline RL for healthcare and provides evidence supporting alternatives beyond the conventional 4-hour setup.

Abstract: Recent theoretical work established the unsupervised identifiability of quantized factors under any diffeomorphism. The theory assumes that quantization thresholds correspond to axis-aligned discontinuities in the probability density of the latent factors. By constraining a learned map to have a density with axis-aligned discontinuities, we can recover the quantization of the factors. However, translating this high-level principle into an effective practical criterion remains challenging, especially under nonlinear maps. Here, we develop a criterion for unsupervised disentanglement by encouraging axis-aligned discontinuities. Discontinuities manifest as sharp changes in the estimated density of factors and form what we call cliffs. Following the definition of independent discontinuities from the theory, we encourage the location of the cliffs along a factor to be independent of the values of the other factors. We show that our method, Cliff, outperforms the baselines on all disentanglement benchmarks, demonstrating its effectiveness in unsupervised disentanglement.

Abstract: Business Email Compromise (BEC) is a sophisticated social engineering threat that manipulates organizational hierarchies and exploits psychological vulnerabilities, leading to significant financial damage. According to the 2024 FBI Internet Crime Report, BEC accounts for over $2.9 billion in annual adjusted losses, presenting significant economic asymmetry: the cost of a False Negative (fraud loss) exceeds the cost of a False Positive (manual review) by orders of magnitude (approximately 1 to 5,480).
  This paper examines two detection paradigms for BEC: the Forensic Psycholinguistic Stream, which utilizes CatBoost to analyze psycholinguistic cues with high interpretability and low latency, and the Semantic Stream, which employs DistilBERT for deep learning-based contextual language understanding, offering superior accuracy at higher computational cost. We evaluated DistilBERT on an adversarially poisoned dataset (N = 7,990) generated via our Black Hole protocol, benchmarked on Tesla T4 GPU infrastructure, achieving superior detection (AUC = 1.0000, F1 = 0.9981) with acceptable real-time latency (7.403 milliseconds). CatBoost achieves competitive detection (AUC = 0.9905, F1 = 0.9486) at 8.4x lower latency (0.885 milliseconds), consuming negligible computational resources. For organizations with GPU infrastructure, DistilBERT offers superior accuracy. CatBoost is preferable for edge deployments or cost-sensitive environments due to comparable security and lower operational costs. Both approaches demonstrate return on investment exceeding 99.96% when optimized through cost-sensitive learning, by significantly reducing false negatives and associated financial losses.

Abstract: Behavior Cloning (BC) is a popular framework for training sequential decision policies from expert demonstrations via supervised learning. As these policies are increasingly being deployed in the real world, their robustness and potential vulnerabilities are an important concern. In this work, we perform the first analysis of the efficacy of clean-label backdoor attacks on BC policies. Our backdoor attacks poison a dataset of demonstrations by injecting a visual trigger to create a spurious correlation that can be exploited at test time. We evaluate how policy vulnerability scales with the fraction of poisoned data, the strength of the trigger, and the trigger type. We also introduce a novel entropy-based test-time trigger attack that substantially degrades policy performance by identifying critical states where test-time triggering of the backdoor is expected to be most effective at degrading performance. We empirically demonstrate that BC policies trained on even minimally poisoned datasets exhibit deceptively high, near-baseline task performance despite being highly vulnerable to backdoor trigger attacks during deployment. Our results underscore the urgent need for more research into the robustness of BC policies, particularly as large-scale datasets are increasingly used to train policies for real-world cyber-physical systems.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) offer strong high-level planning capabilities for reinforcement learning (RL) by decomposing tasks into subgoals. However, their practical utility is limited by poor planning-execution alignment, which reflects a critical gap between abstract plans and actionable, environment-compatible behaviors. This misalignment arises from two interrelated limitations: (1) LLMs often produce subgoals that are semantically plausible but infeasible or irrelevant in the target environment due to insufficient grounding in environment-specific knowledge, and (2) single-LLM planning conflates generation with self-verification, resulting in overconfident yet unreliable subgoals that frequently fail during execution. To address these challenges, we propose Subgoal Graph-Augmented Actor-Critic-Refiner (SGA-ACR), a framework that integrates an environment-specific subgoal graph and structured entity knowledge with a multi-LLM planning pipeline that explicitly separates generation, critique, and refinement to produce executable and verifiable subgoals. A subgoal tracker further monitors execution progress, provides auxiliary rewards, and adaptively updates the subgoal graph to maintain alignment between plans and actions. Experimental results on 22 diverse tasks in the open-world game "Crafter" demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method.

Abstract: Representation learning is fundamental to modern machine learning, powering applications such as text retrieval and multimodal understanding. However, learning robust and generalizable representations remains challenging. While prior work has demonstrated that active noise injection, a form of data augmentation, can enhance encoding performance, most existing methods rely on heuristic or static noise, overlooking the dynamic nature of feature distributions during training. In this work, we systematically study the role of noise in representation learning from both gradient-based and feature distribution perspectives, using InfoNCE loss as a representative example. Focusing on multimodal representation learning, we propose FANoise, a novel feature-adaptive noise injection strategy. By leveraging the dynamics of contrastive learning, FANoise effectively mitigates the negative impacts of noise while preserving its benefits. Under this theoretically grounded framework, comprehensive experiments demonstrate that FANoise consistently improves overall performance on multimodal tasks across various base VLM models.

Abstract: We consider the problem of estimating Ising models over $n$ variables in Total Variation (TV) distance, given $l$ independent samples from the model. While the statistical complexity of the problem is well-understood [DMR20], identifying computationally and statistically efficient algorithms has been challenging. In particular, remarkable progress has occurred in several settings, such as when the underlying graph is a tree [DP21, BGPV21], when the entries of the interaction matrix follow a Gaussian distribution [GM24, CK24], or when the bulk of its eigenvalues lie in a small interval [AJK+24, KLV24], but no unified framework for polynomial-time estimation in TV exists so far. Our main contribution is a unified analysis of the Maximum Pseudo-Likelihood Estimator (MPLE) for two general classes of Ising models. The first class includes models that have bounded operator norm and satisfy the Modified Log-Sobolev Inequality (MLSI), a functional inequality that was introduced to study the convergence of the associated Glauber dynamics to stationarity. In the second class of models, the interaction matrix has bounded infinity norm (or bounded width), which is the most common assumption in the literature for structure learning of Ising models. We show how our general results for these classes yield polynomial-time algorithms and optimal or near-optimal sample complexity guarantees in a variety of settings. Our proofs employ a variety of tools from tensorization inequalities to measure decompositions and concentration bounds.

Abstract: The challenge of separating AI-generated text from human-authored content is becoming more urgent as generative AI technologies like ChatGPT become more widely available. In this work, we address this issue by looking at both the detection of content that has been entirely generated by AI and the identification of human text that has been reworded by AI. In our work, a comprehensive methodology to detect AI- generated text using XLM-RoBERTa, a state-of-the-art multilingual transformer model. Our approach includes rigorous preprocessing, and feature extraction involving perplexity, semantic, and readability features. We fine-tuned the XLM-RoBERTa model on a balanced dataset of human and AI-generated texts and evaluated its performance. The model demonstrated high accuracy and robust performance across various text genres. Additionally, we conducted feature analysis to understand the model's decision-making process, revealing that perplexity and attention-based features are critical in differentiating between human and AI-generated texts. Our findings offer a valuable tool for maintaining academic integrity and contribute to the broader field of AI ethics by promoting transparency and accountability in AI systems. Future research directions include exploring other advanced models and expanding the dataset to enhance the model's generalizability.

Abstract: Massively parallel GPU simulation environments have accelerated reinforcement learning (RL) research by enabling fast data collection for on-policy RL algorithms like Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO). To maximize throughput, it is common to use short rollouts per policy update, increasing the update-to-data (UTD) ra- tio. However, we find that, in this setting, standard synchronous resets introduce harmful nonstationarity, skewing the learning signal and destabilizing training. We introduce staggered resets, a simple yet effective technique where environments are initialized and reset at varied points within the task horizon. This yields training batches with greater temporal diversity, reducing the nonstationarity induced by synchronized rollouts. We characterize dimensions along which RL environments can benefit significantly from staggered resets through illustrative toy environ- ments. We then apply this technique to challenging high-dimensional robotics environments, achieving significantly higher sample efficiency, faster wall-clock convergence, and stronger final performance. Finally, this technique scales better with more parallel environments compared to naive synchronized rollouts.

Abstract: Climate change has intensified the frequency and severity of wildfires, making rapid and accurate prediction of fire spread essential for effective mitigation and response. Physics-based simulators such as FARSITE offer high-fidelity predictions but are computationally intensive, limiting their applicability in real-time decision-making, while existing deep learning models often yield overly smooth predictions that fail to capture the complex, nonlinear dynamics of wildfire propagation. This study proposes an autoregressive conditional generative adversarial network (CGAN) for probabilistic wildfire spread prediction. By formulating the prediction task as an autoregressive problem, the model learns sequential state transitions, ensuring long-term prediction stability. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed CGAN-based model outperforms conventional deep learning models in both overall predictive accuracy and boundary delineation of fire perimeters. These results demonstrate that adversarial learning allows the model to capture the strong nonlinearity and uncertainty of wildfire spread, instead of simply fitting the pixel average. Furthermore, the autoregressive framework facilitates systematic temporal forecasting of wildfire evolution. The proposed CGAN-based autoregressive framework enhances both the accuracy and physical interpretability of wildfire spread prediction, offering a promising foundation for time-sensitive response and evacuation planning.

Abstract: Temporal distribution shift (TDS) erodes the long-term accuracy of recommender systems, yet industrial practice still relies on periodic incremental training, which struggles to capture both stable and transient patterns. Existing approaches such as invariant learning and self-supervised learning offer partial solutions but often suffer from unstable temporal generalization, representation collapse, or inefficient data utilization. To address these limitations, we propose ELBO$_\text{TDS}$, a probabilistic framework that integrates seamlessly into industry-scale incremental learning pipelines. First, we identify key shifting factors through statistical analysis of real-world production data and design a simple yet effective data augmentation strategy that resamples these time-varying factors to extend the training support. Second, to harness the benefits of this extended distribution while preventing representation collapse, we model the temporal recommendation scenario using a causal graph and derive a self-supervised variational objective, ELBO$_\text{TDS}$, grounded in the causal structure. Extensive experiments supported by both theoretical and empirical analysis demonstrate that our method achieves superior temporal generalization, yielding a 2.33\% uplift in GMV per user and has been successfully deployed in Shopee Product Search.

Abstract: Dairy farmers should decide to keep or cull a cow based on an objective assessment of her likely performance in the herd. For this purpose, farmers need to identify more resilient cows, which can cope better with farm conditions and complete more lactations. This decision-making process is inherently complex, with significant environmental and economic implications. In this study, we develop an AI-driven model to predict cow longevity using historical multivariate time-series data recorded from birth. Leveraging advanced AI techniques, specifically Multi-Head Attention Transformers, we analysed approximately 780,000 records from 19,000 unique cows across 7 farms in Australia. The results demonstrate that our model achieves an overall determination coefficient of 83% in predicting herd life across the studied farms, highlighting its potential for practical application in dairy herd management.

Abstract: Automatic Modulation Classification (AMC) is a core technology for future wireless communication systems, enabling the identification of modulation schemes without prior knowledge. This capability is essential for applications in cognitive radio, spectrum monitoring, and intelligent communication networks. We propose an AMC system based on a hybrid Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) architecture, integrated with a Software Defined Radio (SDR) platform. The proposed architecture leverages CNNs for spatial feature extraction and LSTMs for capturing temporal dependencies, enabling efficient handling of complex, time-varying communication signals. The system's practical ability was demonstrated by identifying over-the-air (OTA) signals from a custom-built FM transmitter alongside other modulation schemes. The system was trained on a hybrid dataset combining the RadioML2018 dataset with a custom-generated dataset, featuring samples at Signal-to-Noise Ratios (SNRs) from 0 to 30dB. System performance was evaluated using accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, and the Area Under the Receiver Operating Characteristic Curve (AUC-ROC). The optimized model achieved 93.48% accuracy, 93.53% precision, 93.48% recall, and an F1 score of 93.45%. The AUC-ROC analysis confirmed the model's discriminative power, even in noisy conditions. This paper's experimental results validate the effectiveness of the hybrid CNN-LSTM architecture for AMC, suggesting its potential application in adaptive spectrum management and advanced cognitive radio systems.

Abstract: Wi-Fi channel state information (CSI)-based sensing provides a non-invasive, device-free approach for tasks such as human activity recognition and crowd counting, but large-scale deployment is hindered by the need for extensive site-specific training data. Federated learning (FL) offers a way to avoid raw data sharing but is challenged by heterogeneous sensing data and device resources. This paper proposes FedAPA, a collaborative Wi-Fi CSI-based sensing algorithm that uses adaptive prototype aggregation (APA) strategy to assign similarity-based weights to peer prototypes, enabling adaptive client contributions and yielding a personalized global prototype for each client instead of a fixed-weight aggregation. During local training, we adopt a hybrid objective that combines classification learning with representation contrastive learning to align local and global knowledge. We provide a convergence analysis of FedAPA and evaluate it in a real-world distributed Wi-Fi crowd counting scenario with six environments and up to 20 people. The results show that our method outperform multiple baselines in terms of accuracy, F1 score, mean absolute error (MAE), and communication overhead, with FedAPA achieving at least a 9.65% increase in accuracy, a 9% gain in F1 score, a 0.29 reduction in MAE, and a 95.94% reduction in communication overhead.

Abstract: Fine-tuning large language models (LLMs) for downstream tasks typically exhibit a fundamental safety-capability tradeoff, where improving task performance degrades safety alignment even on benign datasets. This degradation persists across standard approaches including supervised finetuning (SFT) and reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF). While reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) has emerged as a promising alternative that optimizes models on objectively measurable tasks, its safety implications remain unexplored. We present the first comprehensive theoretical and empirical analysis of safety properties in RLVR. Theoretically, we derive upper bounds on safety drift under KL-constrained optimization and prove conditions under which safety degradation is eliminated. Empirically, we conduct extensive experiments across five adversarial safety benchmarks, demonstrating that RLVR can simultaneously enhance reasoning capabilities while maintaining or improving safety guardrails. Our comprehensive ablation studies examine the effects of optimization algorithms, model scale, and task domains. Our findings challenge the prevailing assumption of an inevitable safety capability trade-off, and establish that a specific training methodology can achieve both objectives simultaneously, providing insights for the safe deployment of reasoning-capable LLMs.

Abstract: Diffusion planning is a promising method for learning high-performance policies from offline data. To avoid the impact of discrepancies between planning and reality on performance, previous works generate new plans at each time step. However, this incurs significant computational overhead and leads to lower decision frequencies, and frequent plan switching may also affect performance. In contrast, humans might create detailed short-term plans and more general, sometimes vague, long-term plans, and adjust them over time. Inspired by this, we propose the Temporal Diffusion Planner (TDP) which improves decision efficiency by distributing the denoising steps across the time dimension. TDP begins by generating an initial plan that becomes progressively more vague over time. At each subsequent time step, rather than generating an entirely new plan, TDP updates the previous one with a small number of denoising steps. This reduces the average number of denoising steps, improving decision efficiency. Additionally, we introduce an automated replanning mechanism to prevent significant deviations between the plan and reality. Experiments on D4RL show that, compared to previous works that generate new plans every time step, TDP improves the decision-making frequency by 11-24.8 times while achieving higher or comparable performance.

Abstract: Offline data selection and online self-refining generation, which enhance the data quality, are crucial steps in adapting large language models (LLMs) to specific downstream tasks. We tackle offline data selection and online self-refining generations through an optimization perspective. Specifically, bilevel data selection is used for offline data selection with respect to the validation dataset, and we treat online self-refining generation as a model adaptation step of selecting the model trained on current responses that best fits the validation data. Our framework offers a unified understanding of offline data selection and self-refining generation by assigning a learned data weight to each question and response, either explicitly or implicitly. For the first time, we theoretically demonstrate the effectiveness of the bilevel data selection framework and demonstrate its performance gains over unfiltered direct mixing baselines. By combining offline data with validation-weighted online generations, our method enhances fine-tuning performance. Experiments on quality enhancement and safety-aware LLM fine-tuning validate its effectiveness.

Abstract: We propose a novel randomized algorithm for constructing binary neural networks with tunable accuracy. This approach is motivated by hyperdimensional computing (HDC), which is a brain-inspired paradigm that leverages high-dimensional vector representations, offering efficient hardware implementation and robustness to model corruptions. Unlike traditional low-precision methods that use quantization, we consider binary embeddings of data as points in the hypercube equipped with the Hamming distance. We propose a novel family of floating-point neural networks, G-Nets, which are general enough to mimic standard network layers. Each floating-point G-Net has a randomized binary embedding, an embedded hyperdimensional (EHD) G-Net, that retains the accuracy of its floating-point counterparts, with theoretical guarantees, due to the concentration of measure. Empirically, our binary models match convolutional neural network accuracies and outperform prior HDC models by large margins, for example, we achieve almost 30\% higher accuracy on CIFAR-10 compared to prior HDC models. G-Nets are a theoretically justified bridge between neural networks and randomized binary neural networks, opening a new direction for constructing robust binary/quantized deep learning models. Our implementation is available at https://github.com/GNet2025/GNet.

Abstract: Effective post-training is essential to align Large Language Models (LLMs) with specialized biomedical knowledge to accelerate life science research. However, current approaches face significant limitations. First, biomedical reasoning involves intricate mechanisms often represented by sparse textual data. Standard Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) tends to overfit to surface-level instruction patterns without effectively internalizing this fragmented scientific knowledge. Second, Reinforcement Learning (RL) is impractical for this domain, as defining meaningful rewards often necessitates prohibitive experimental validation (e.g., wet-lab verification of drug responses), rendering real-time feedback unfeasible. We propose Balanced Fine-Tuning (BFT), an efficient post-training method designed to learn complex reasoning from sparse data without external reward signals. BFT operates through a two-layer weighting mechanism: 1. At the token level, it scales loss via prediction probabilities to stabilize gradients and prevent overfitting; 2. At the sample level, it uses "minimum group confidence" to adaptively enhance the learning of hard samples. Experiments demonstrate that BFT significantly outperforms SFT. In medical tasks, it enables LLMs to acquire knowledge that SFT misses. In biological tasks, BFT-based LLMs surpass GeneAgent (an accurate agent for biology analysis) in biological process reasoning. Moreover, the text embeddings generated by BFT can be directly applied to downstream tasks, such as gene interaction and single-cell perturbation response prediction. These results indicate that BFT facilitates broad applications of LLMs in biomedical research.

Abstract: Inverse problems in the physical sciences are often ill-conditioned in input space, making progress step-size sensitive. We propose the Deceptron, a lightweight bidirectional module that learns a local inverse of a differentiable forward surrogate. Training combines a supervised fit, forward-reverse consistency, a lightweight spectral penalty, a soft bias tie, and a Jacobian Composition Penalty (JCP) that encourages $J_g(f(x))\,J_f(x)\!\approx\!I$ via JVP/VJP probes. At solve time, D-IPG (Deceptron Inverse-Preconditioned Gradient) takes a descent step in output space, pulls it back through $g$, and projects under the same backtracking and stopping rules as baselines. On Heat-1D initial-condition recovery and a Damped Oscillator inverse problem, D-IPG reaches a fixed normalized tolerance with $\sim$20$\times$ fewer iterations on Heat and $\sim$2-3$\times$ fewer on Oscillator than projected gradient, competitive in iterations and cost with Gauss-Newton. Diagnostics show JCP reduces a measured composition error and tracks iteration gains. We also preview a single-scale 2D instantiation, DeceptronNet (v0), that learns few-step corrections under a strict fairness protocol and exhibits notably fast convergence.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are predominantly deployed as dense transformers, where every parameter in every feed-forward block is activated for every token. While architecturally simple, this is computationally inefficient, since inference costs scale linearly with parameter count. Recent upcycling methods such as MoEfication, CMoE, ToMoE, and MoORE reveal that much of the useful computation lives in sparse, semi-modular substructures inside dense feed-forward networks, but these approaches typically rely on clustering, activation profiling, singular value decomposition, or custom routing that requires calibration data. This paper introduces MLPMoE (MLP Mixture-of-Experts), a training-free, deterministic transformation that restructures the dense MLP in transformer blocks into a static, high-cardinality mixture of experts. The transformation uses simple tensor slicing and summation, reinterpreting the algebra of tensor parallelism as a topological conversion rather than a distributed training pattern. We further introduce Fractal Fade (differential branch sparsity) and Compensated Pruning (variance-preserving branch reduction) as lightweight mechanisms for structured sparsity. On Qwen2.5-0.5B-Instruct and DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Llama-8B, the zero-shot MLPMoE transform changes a proxy perplexity metric by less than 0.05 percent while keeping the parameter count effectively constant. On the 8B model, differential sparsity removes about 20 percent of MLP parameters while keeping perplexity within about 2 percent of the dense baseline. The method operates entirely post hoc on existing checkpoints and does not require gradients, calibration sets, or router training.

Abstract: Various neuroimaging studies suffer from small sample size problem which often limit their reliability. Meta-analysis addresses this challenge by aggregating findings from different studies to identify consistent patterns of brain activity. However, traditional approaches based on keyword retrieval or linear mappings often overlook the rich hierarchical structure in the brain. In this work, we propose a novel framework that leverages hyperbolic geometry to bridge the gap between neuroscience literature and brain activation maps. By embedding text from research articles and corresponding brain images into a shared hyperbolic space via the Lorentz model, our method captures both semantic similarity and hierarchical organization inherent in neuroimaging data. In the hyperbolic space, our method performs multi-level neuroimaging meta-analysis (MNM) by 1) aligning brain and text embeddings for semantic correspondence, 2) guiding hierarchy between text and brain activations, and 3) preserving the hierarchical relationships within brain activation patterns. Experimental results demonstrate that our model outperforms baselines, offering a robust and interpretable paradigm of multi-level neuroimaging meta-analysis via hyperbolic brain-text representation.

Abstract: Large-scale recommendations commonly adopt a multi-stage cascading ranking system paradigm to balance effectiveness and efficiency. Early Stage Ranking (ESR) systems utilize the "user-item decoupling" approach, where independently learned user and item representations are only combined at the final layer. While efficient, this design is limited in effectiveness, as it struggles to capture fine-grained user-item affinities and cross-signals. To address these, we propose the Generative Early Stage Ranking (GESR) paradigm, introducing the Mixture of Attention (MoA) module which leverages diverse attention mechanisms to bridge the effectiveness gap: the Hard Matching Attention (HMA) module encodes explicit cross-signals by computing raw match counts between user and item features; the Target-Aware Self Attention module generates target-aware user representations conditioned on the item, enabling more personalized learning; and the Cross Attention modules facilitate early and more enriched interactions between user-item features. MoA's specialized attention encodings are further refined in the final layer through a Multi-Logit Parameterized Gating (MLPG) module, which integrates the newly learned embeddings via gating and produces secondary logits that are fused with the primary logit. To address the efficiency and latency challenges, we have introduced a comprehensive suite of optimization techniques. These span from custom kernels that maximize the capabilities of the latest hardware to efficient serving solutions powered by caching mechanisms. The proposed GESR paradigm has shown substantial improvements in topline metrics, engagement, and consumption tasks, as validated by both offline and online experiments. To the best of our knowledge, this marks the first successful deployment of full target-aware attention sequence modeling within an ESR stage at such a scale.

Abstract: Diffusion Language Models (DLMs) have recently emerged as a strong alternative to autoregressive language models (LMs). DLMs offer comparable accuracy with faster inference speed via parallel decoding. However, standard DLM decoding strategies relying on high-confidence tokens encounter an inherent information-theoretic bottleneck that restricts decoding progress and ultimately slows generation. We demonstrate both theoretically and empirically that prioritizing high-confidence tokens is inherently inefficient. High-probability tokens carry negligible information and strictly relying on them limits the effective progress made in each decoding round. We prove that the number of decoding rounds must grow linearly with the sample's total information (negative log-likelihood) and inversely with the per-round information budget, establishing a bits-to-rounds principle. We also propose Explore-Then-Exploit (ETE), a training-free decoding strategy that maximizes information throughput and decoding efficiency. ETE combines cross-block decoding with targeted exploration of high-uncertainty tokens to reshape the conditional distribution and trigger cascades of confident predictions. Experiments verify our theoretical bounds and demonstrate that ETE consistently reduces the required number of decoding rounds compared to confidence-only baselines without compromising generation quality.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have achieved impressive results in code generation, yet struggle with program verification, especially in interactive proof frameworks such as Lean4. A central challenge is scalability: verified synthesis requires not just code, but also precise specifications and correctness proofs, and existing approaches rarely span all three domains. We present BRIDGE, the first systematic study of structured prompting for scalable verified program generation. BRIDGE decomposes verification into three interconnected domains: Code (executable implementations), Specifications (formal intent statements), and Proofs (constructive correctness arguments). Our key idea is to elicit distinct reasoning behaviors functional, specification-driven, and proof-oriented as intermediate representations that preserve semantic structure and connect these domains. Through systematic ablations, we show that this approach substantially improves both accuracy and efficiency beyond standard error feedback methods. For example, functional reasoning improves correctness of code in formal languages (Lean4) by nearly 1.5x (pass@5) over direct baselines. In inference-time compute, functional reasoning is also 2x more efficient, achieving higher pass rates with fewer generations and lower total sampling budgets. Similarly, we find that specification-driven prompting boosts Python coding pass rates by up to 17.5%. These findings suggest that structured domain alignment is a promising direction for advancing verified synthesis. BRIDGE establishes a foundation for training via expert iteration or RLVR, enabling models to internalize these reasoning strategies across code, specifications, and proofs.

Abstract: Mixed Integer Linear Programming (MILP) is a fundamental class of NP-hard problems that has garnered significant attention from both academia and industry. The Branch-and-Bound (B\&B) method is the dominant approach for solving MILPs and the branching plays an important role in B\&B methods. Neural-based learning frameworks have recently been developed to enhance branching policies and the efficiency of solving MILPs. However, these methods still struggle with semantic variation across depths, the scarcity of upstream nodes, and the costly collection of strong branching samples. To address these issues, we propose \ours, a Dynamic \underline{\textbf{S}}tratified \underline{\textbf{C}}ontrastive Training Framework for \underline{\textbf{MILP}} Branching. It groups branch-and-bound nodes based on their feature distributions and trains a GCNN-based discriminative model to progressively separate nodes across groups, learning finer-grained node representations throughout the tree. To address data scarcity and imbalance at upstream nodes, we introduce an upstream-augmented MILP derivation procedure that generates both theoretically equivalent and perturbed instances. \ours~effectively models subtle semantic differences between nodes, significantly enhancing branching accuracy and solving efficiency, particularly for upstream nodes. Extensive experiments on standard MILP benchmarks demonstrate that our method enhances branching accuracy, reduces solving time, and generalizes effectively to unseen instances.

Abstract: Fair clustering has gained increasing attention in recent years, especially in applications involving socially sensitive attributes. However, existing fair clustering methods often lack interpretability, limiting their applicability in high-stakes scenarios where understanding the rationale behind clustering decisions is essential. In this work, we address this limitation by proposing an interpretable and fair clustering framework, which integrates fairness constraints into the structure of decision trees. Our approach constructs interpretable decision trees that partition the data while ensuring fair treatment across protected groups. To further enhance the practicality of our framework, we also introduce a variant that requires no fairness hyperparameter tuning, achieved through post-pruning a tree constructed without fairness constraints. Extensive experiments on both real-world and synthetic datasets demonstrate that our method not only delivers competitive clustering performance and improved fairness, but also offers additional advantages such as interpretability and the ability to handle multiple sensitive attributes. These strengths enable our method to perform robustly under complex fairness constraints, opening new possibilities for equitable and transparent clustering.

Abstract: Artificial intelligence is retracing the Internet's path from centralized provision to distributed creation. Initially, resource-intensive computation concentrates within institutions capable of training and serving large models.Eventually, as federated learning matures, billions of edge devices holding sensitive data will be able to collectively improve models without surrendering raw information, enabling both contribution and consumption at scale. This democratic vision remains unrealized due to certain compositional gaps; aggregators handle updates without accountability, economic mechanisms are lacking and even when present remain vulnerable to gaming, coordination serializes state modifications limiting scalability, and governance permits retroactive manipulation. This work addresses these gaps by leveraging cryptographic receipts to prove aggregation correctness, geometric novelty measurement to prevent incentive gaming, parallel object ownership to achieve linear scalability, and time-locked policies to check retroactive manipulation.

Abstract: Understanding how chemical perturbations propagate through biological systems is essential for robust molecular property prediction. While most existing methods focus on chemical structures alone, recent advances highlight the crucial role of cellular responses such as morphology and gene expression in shaping drug effects. However, current cell-aware approaches face two key limitations: (1) modality incompleteness in external biological data, and (2) insufficient modeling of hierarchical dependencies across molecular, cellular, and genomic levels. We propose CHMR (Cell-aware Hierarchical Multi-modal Representations), a robust framework that jointly models local-global dependencies between molecules and cellular responses and captures latent biological hierarchies via a novel tree-structured vector quantization module. Evaluated on nine public benchmarks spanning 728 tasks, CHMR outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, yielding average improvements of 3.6% on classification and 17.2% on regression tasks. These results demonstrate the advantage of hierarchy-aware, multimodal learning for reliable and biologically grounded molecular representations, offering a generalizable framework for integrative biomedical modeling.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used as evaluators in lieu of humans. While scalable, their judgments are noisy due to imperfect specificity and sensitivity of LLMs, leading to biased accuracy estimates. Although bias-correction methods exist, they are underutilized in LLM research and typically assume exact knowledge of the model's specificity and sensitivity. Furthermore, in general we only have estimates of these values and it is not well known how to properly construct confidence intervals using only estimates. This work presents a simple plug-in framework that corrects such bias and constructs confidence intervals reflecting uncertainty from both test and calibration dataset, enabling practical and statistically sound LLM-based evaluation. Additionally, to reduce uncertainty in the accuracy estimate, we introduce an adaptive algorithm that efficiently allocates calibration sample sizes.

Abstract: Spiking neural networks (SNNs) have emerged as prominent candidates for embedded and edge AI. Their inherent low power consumption makes them far more efficient than conventional ANNs in scenarios where energy budgets are tightly constrained. In parallel, federated learning (FL) has become the prevailing training paradigm in such settings, enabling on-device learning while limiting the exposure of raw data. However, gradient inversion attacks represent a critical privacy threat in FL, where sensitive training data can be reconstructed directly from shared gradients. While this vulnerability has been widely investigated in conventional ANNs, its implications for SNNs remain largely unexplored. In this work, we present the first comprehensive empirical study of gradient leakage in SNNs across diverse data domains. SNNs are inherently non-differentiable and are typically trained using surrogate gradients, which we hypothesized would be less correlated with the original input and thus less informative from a privacy perspective. To investigate this, we adapt different gradient leakage attacks to the spike domain. Our experiments reveal a striking contrast with conventional ANNs: whereas ANN gradients reliably expose salient input content, SNN gradients yield noisy, temporally inconsistent reconstructions that fail to recover meaningful spatial or temporal structure. These results indicate that the combination of event-driven dynamics and surrogate-gradient training substantially reduces gradient informativeness. To the best of our knowledge, this work provides the first systematic benchmark of gradient inversion attacks for spiking architectures, highlighting the inherent privacy-preserving potential of neuromorphic computation.

Abstract: Accurate remaining useful life (RUL) prediction hinges on the quality of health indicators (HIs), yet existing methods often fail to disentangle complex degradation mechanisms in multi-sensor systems or quantify uncertainty in HI reliability. This paper introduces a novel framework for HI construction, advancing three key contributions. First, we adapt Reconstruction along Projected Pathways (RaPP) as a health indicator (HI) for RUL prediction for the first time, showing that it outperforms traditional reconstruction error metrics. Second, we show that augmenting RaPP-derived HIs with aleatoric and epistemic uncertainty quantification (UQ) via Monte Carlo dropout and probabilistic latent spaces- significantly improves RUL-prediction robustness. Third, and most critically, we propose indicator groups, a paradigm that isolates sensor subsets to model system-specific degradations, giving rise to our novel method, I-GLIDE which enables interpretable, mechanism-specific diagnostics. Evaluated on data sourced from aerospace and manufacturing systems, our approach achieves marked improvements in accuracy and generalizability compared to state-of-the-art HI methods while providing actionable insights into system failure pathways. This work bridges the gap between anomaly detection and prognostics, offering a principled framework for uncertainty-aware degradation modeling in complex systems.

Abstract: Accurate and efficient seismic response prediction is essential for the design of resilient structures. While the Finite Element Method (FEM) remains the standard for nonlinear seismic analysis, its high computational demands limit its scalability and real time applicability. Recent developments in deep learning, particularly Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs), and Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) models, have shown promise in reducing the computational cost of nonlinear seismic analysis of structures. However, these data driven models often struggle to generalize and capture the underlying physics, leading to reduced reliability. We propose a novel Physics Informed U Net LSTM framework that integrates physical laws with deep learning to enhance both accuracy and efficiency. By embedding domain specific constraints into the learning process, the proposed model achieves improved predictive performance over conventional Machine Learning architectures. This hybrid approach bridges the gap between purely data driven methods and physics based modeling, offering a robust and computationally efficient alternative for seismic response prediction of structures.

Our approach achieves a 30 times speed-up over the standard baseline while also enhancing the quality of the generated sequences for classification tasks.

Abstract: Score-based generative models (SGMs) have demonstrated unparalleled sampling quality and diversity in numerous fields, such as image generation, voice synthesis, and tabular data synthesis, etc. Inspired by those outstanding results, we apply SGMs to synthesize time-series by learning its conditional score function. To this end, we present a conditional score network for time-series synthesis, deriving a denoising score matching loss tailored for our purposes. In particular, our presented denoising score matching loss is the conditional denoising score matching loss for time-series synthesis. In addition, our framework is such flexible that both regular and irregular time-series can be synthesized with minimal changes to our model design. Finally, we obtain exceptional synthesis performance on various time-series datasets, achieving state-of-the-art sampling diversity and quality.

Abstract: Masked Diffusion Language Models (MDLMs) have recently emerged as a promising alternative to Autoregressive Language Models (ARLMs), leveraging a denoising objective that, in principle, should enable more uniform context utilisation. In this work, we examine the context comprehension abilities of MDLMs and uncover two key limitations. First, despite their more global training objective and bidirectional attention mechanism, similarly to ARLMS, MDLMs exhibit a strong locality bias: performance is highly sensitive to the position of relevant information within the input, favouring local over distant context. Second, we show that appending a large number of mask tokens--required for generation--can significantly degrade context comprehension. Through systematic ablations, we find that these masks act as distractors, reducing the model's ability to process relevant information. To address this, we introduce a mask-agnostic loss function that encourages predictions to remain invariant to the number of appended masks. Fine-tuning with this objective substantially mitigates the distracting effect of masks, improving robustness of MDLMs. Overall, our findings reveal critical limitations of the current MDLM training paradigm and provide actionable insights for building diffusion-based language models with stronger context comprehension.

Abstract: Machine learning (ML) is increasingly adopted in scientific research, yet the quality and reliability of results often depend on how experiments are designed and documented. Poor baselines, inconsistent preprocessing, or insufficient validation can lead to misleading conclusions about model performance. This paper presents a practical and structured guide for conducting ML experiments in scientific applications, focussing on reproducibility, fair comparison, and transparent reporting. We outline a step-by-step workflow, from dataset preparation to model selection and evaluation, and propose metrics that account for overfitting and instability across validation folds, including the Logarithmic Overfitting Ratio (LOR) and the Composite Overfitting Score (COS). Through recommended practices and example reporting formats, this work aims to support researchers in establishing robust baselines and drawing valid evidence-based insights from ML models applied to scientific problems.

Abstract: Adversarial Inverse Reinforcement Learning (AIRL) has shown promise in addressing the sparse reward problem in reinforcement learning (RL) by inferring dense reward functions from expert demonstrations. However, its performance in highly complex, imperfect-information settings remains largely unexplored. To explore this gap, we evaluate AIRL in the context of Heads-Up Limit Hold'em (HULHE) poker, a domain characterized by sparse, delayed rewards and significant uncertainty. In this setting, we find that AIRL struggles to infer a sufficiently informative reward function. To overcome this limitation, we contribute Hybrid-AIRL (H-AIRL), an extension that enhances reward inference and policy learning by incorporating a supervised loss derived from expert data and a stochastic regularization mechanism. We evaluate H-AIRL on a carefully selected set of Gymnasium benchmarks and the HULHE poker setting. Additionally, we analyze the learned reward function through visualization to gain deeper insights into the learning process. Our experimental results show that H-AIRL achieves higher sample efficiency and more stable learning compared to AIRL. This highlights the benefits of incorporating supervised signals into inverse RL and establishes H-AIRL as a promising framework for tackling challenging, real-world settings.

Abstract: The utility of an explanation method critically depends on its fidelity to the underlying machine learning model. Especially in high-stakes medical settings, clinicians and regulators require explanations that faithfully reflect the model's decision process. Existing fidelity metrics such as Infidelity rely on Monte Carlo approximation, which demands numerous model evaluations and introduces uncertainty due to random sampling. This work proposes a novel metric for evaluating the fidelity of local feature attribution methods by modifying the existing Prediction Change (PC) metric within the Guided Perturbation Experiment. By incorporating the direction of both perturbation and attribution, the proposed Directed Prediction Change (DPC) metric achieves an almost tenfold speedup and eliminates randomness, resulting in a deterministic and trustworthy evaluation procedure that measures the same property as local Infidelity. DPC is evaluated on two datasets (skin lesion images and financial tabular data), two black-box models, seven explanation algorithms, and a wide range of hyperparameters. Across $4\,744$ distinct explanations, the results demonstrate that DPC, together with PC, enables a holistic and computationally efficient evaluation of both baseline-oriented and local feature attribution methods, while providing deterministic and reproducible outcomes.

Abstract: Natural disasters remain a major challenge for Bangladesh, so real-time monitoring and quick response systems are essential. In this study, we present BanglaMM-Disaster, an end-to-end deep learning-based multimodal framework for disaster classification in Bangla, using both textual and visual data from social media. We constructed a new dataset of 5,037 Bangla social media posts, each consisting of a caption and a corresponding image, annotated into one of nine disaster-related categories. The proposed model integrates transformer-based text encoders, including BanglaBERT, mBERT, and XLM-RoBERTa, with CNN backbones such as ResNet50, DenseNet169, and MobileNetV2, to process the two modalities. Using early fusion, the best model achieves 83.76% accuracy. This surpasses the best text-only baseline by 3.84% and the image-only baseline by 16.91%. Our analysis also shows reduced misclassification across all classes, with noticeable improvements for ambiguous examples. This work fills a key gap in Bangla multimodal disaster analysis and demonstrates the benefits of combining multiple data types for real-time disaster response in low-resource settings.

Abstract: Stability of neural network weights is critical when training transformer models. The query and key weights are particularly problematic, as they tend to grow large without any intervention. Applying normalization to queries and keys, known as `QK norm', fixes stability issues in practice, but is not always applicable. For example, QK norm is not compatible with Multi Latent Attention (MLA) because QK norm requires full materialization of queries and keys during inference, which is not done in MLA. In this paper we suggest that controlling the changes to logits is important for stability. We show that these changes are controllable by assigning parameter-dependent learning rates to the query and key weights. We find that our cheap intervention allows us to increase the base learning rate of the network, outperform other methods in the MLA setting, and achieve performance competitive with QK norm when using Multi-head Attention.

Abstract: Handling contaminated data poses a critical challenge in anomaly detection, as traditional models assume training on purely normal data. Conventional methods mitigate contamination by relying on fixed contamination ratios, but discrepancies between assumed and actual ratios can severely degrade performance, especially in noisy environments where normal and abnormal data distributions overlap. To address these limitations, we propose Adaptive and Aggressive Rejection (AAR), a novel method that dynamically excludes anomalies using a modified z-score and Gaussian mixture model-based thresholds. AAR effectively balances the trade-off between preserving normal data and excluding anomalies by integrating hard and soft rejection strategies. Extensive experiments on two image datasets and thirty tabular datasets demonstrate that AAR outperforms the state-of-the-art method by 0.041 AUROC. By providing a scalable and reliable solution, AAR enhances robustness against contaminated datasets, paving the way for broader real-world applications in domains such as security and healthcare.

Abstract: Aspect-Based Sentiment Analysis (ABSA) has emerged as a critical tool for extracting fine-grained sentiment insights from user-generated content, particularly in e-commerce and social media domains. However, research on Bangla ABSA remains significantly underexplored due to the absence of comprehensive datasets and specialized frameworks for triplet extraction in this language. This paper introduces BanglaASTE, a novel framework for Aspect Sentiment Triplet Extraction (ASTE) that simultaneously identifies aspect terms, opinion expressions, and sentiment polarities from Bangla product reviews. Our contributions include: (1) creation of the first annotated Bangla ASTE dataset containing 3,345 product reviews collected from major e-commerce platforms including Daraz, Facebook, and Rokomari; (2) development of a hybrid classification framework that employs graph-based aspect-opinion matching with semantic similarity techniques; and (3) implementation of an ensemble model combining BanglaBERT contextual embeddings with XGBoost boosting algorithms for enhanced triplet extraction performance. Experimental results demonstrate that our ensemble approach achieves superior performance with 89.9% accuracy and 89.1% F1-score, significantly outperforming baseline models across all evaluation metrics. The framework effectively addresses key challenges in Bangla text processing including informal expressions, spelling variations, and data sparsity. This research advances the state-of-the-art in low-resource language sentiment analysis and provides a scalable solution for Bangla e-commerce analytics applications.

Abstract: The rigid, uniform allocation of computation in standard Transformer (TF) architectures can limit their efficiency and scalability, particularly for large-scale models and long sequences. Addressing this, we introduce Subjective Depth Transformers (SDT) and Subjective Timescale Transformers (STT), two distinct architectures that leverage Bayesian surprise signals to dynamically route computation, learning where and when to compute within decoder-only TFs. SDT augments a decoder-only stack with alternating Decision and Dynamic layers: a Decision layer computes a full block 'posterior' and a lightweight 'prior,' while a Dynamic layer employs fixed-capacity Top-K routing based on Bayesian surprise (Expected and Unexpected Change), maintaining a static compute graph. STT extends this conditional computation to the temporal domain: a transition network predicts residual updates, forming a temporal 'change hypothesis' that informs a router to dynamically execute or bypass TF blocks for each token, managing KV-cache contributions. Both architectures exhibit the predicted shift from novelty to prediction driven gating over training, suggesting alignment with surprise based principles. While operating at reduced capacity, they offer preliminary insights into the compute-accuracy trade-offs of conditional computation. The proposed architectures establish a flexible framework for efficiency, reducing self-attention computation by 75% and KV-cache requirements by 50% within each compute skipping layer, setting a pathway for more efficient models.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Deep neural networks (DNNs) and Kolmogorov-Arnold networks (KANs) are popular methods for function approximation due to their flexibility and expressivity. However, they typically require a large number of trainable parameters to produce a suitable approximation. Beyond making the resulting network less transparent, overparameterization creates a large optimization space, likely producing local minima in training that have quite different generalization errors. In this case, network initialization can have an outsize impact on the model's out-of-sample accuracy. For these reasons, we propose shallow universal polynomial networks (SUPNs). These networks replace all but the last hidden layer with a single layer of polynomials with learnable coefficients, leveraging the strengths of DNNs and polynomials to achieve sufficient expressivity with far fewer parameters. We prove that SUPNs converge at the same rate as the best polynomial approximation of the same degree, and we derive explicit formulas for quasi-optimal SUPN parameters. We complement theory with an extensive suite of numerical experiments involving SUPNs, DNNs, KANs, and polynomial projection in one, two, and ten dimensions, consisting of over 13,000 trained models. On the target functions we numerically studied, for a given number of trainable parameters, the approximation error and variability are often lower for SUPNs than for DNNs and KANs by an order of magnitude. In our examples, SUPNs even outperform polynomial projection on non-smooth functions.

Abstract: Ensemble learning improves classification performance by combining multiple base classifiers. While increasing the number of classifiers generally enhances accuracy, excessively large ensembles can lead to computational inefficiency and diminishing returns. This paper investigates the relationship between ensemble size and performance through the lens of linear independence among classifier votes in data streams. We propose that ensembles composed of linearly independent classifiers maximize representational capacity, particularly under a geometric model. We then generalize the importance of linear independence to the weighted majority voting problem. By modeling the probability of achieving linear independence among classifier outputs, we derive a theoretical framework that explains the trade-off between ensemble size and accuracy. Our analysis leads to a theoretical estimate of the ensemble size required to achieve a user-specified probability of linear independence. We validate our theory through experiments on both real-world and synthetic datasets using two ensemble methods, OzaBagging and GOOWE. Our results confirm that this theoretical estimate effectively identifies the point of performance saturation for robust ensembles like OzaBagging. Conversely, for complex weighting schemes like GOOWE, our framework reveals that high theoretical diversity can trigger algorithmic instability. Our implementation is publicly available to support reproducibility and future research.

Abstract: We study two-layer neural networks and train these with a particle-based method called consensus-based optimization (CBO). We compare the performance of CBO against Adam on two test cases and demonstrate how a hybrid approach, combining CBO with Adam, provides faster convergence than CBO. In the context of multi-task learning, we recast CBO into a formulation that offers less memory overhead. The CBO method allows for a mean-field limit formulation, which we couple with the mean-field limit of the neural network. To this end, we first reformulate CBO within the optimal transport framework. Finally, in the limit of infinitely many particles, we define the corresponding dynamics on the Wasserstein-over-Wasserstein space and show that the variance decreases monotonically.

Abstract: Translating non-invasive signals such as photoplethysmography (PPG) and ballistocardiography (BCG) into clinically meaningful signals like arterial blood pressure (ABP) is vital for continuous, low-cost healthcare monitoring. However, temporal misalignment in multimodal signal transformation impairs transformation accuracy, especially in capturing critical features like ABP peaks. Conventional synchronization methods often rely on strong similarity assumptions or manual tuning, while existing Learning with Noisy Labels (LNL) approaches are ineffective under time-shifted supervision, either discarding excessive data or failing to correct label shifts. To address this challenge, we propose ShiftSyncNet, a meta-learning-based bi-level optimization framework that automatically mitigates performance degradation due to time misalignment. It comprises a transformation network (TransNet) and a time-shift correction network (SyncNet), where SyncNet learns time offsets between training pairs and applies Fourier phase shifts to align supervision signals. Experiments on one real-world industrial dataset and two public datasets show that ShiftSyncNet outperforms strong baselines by 9.4%, 6.0%, and 12.8%, respectively. The results highlight its effectiveness in correcting time shifts, improving label quality, and enhancing transformation accuracy across diverse misalignment scenarios, pointing toward a unified direction for addressing temporal inconsistencies in multimodal physiological transformation.

Abstract: Deploying Transformer models on edge devices is limited by latency and energy budgets. While INT8 quantization effectively accelerates the primary matrix multiplications, it exposes the softmax as the dominant bottleneck. This stage incurs a costly dequantize-softmax-requantize detour, which can account for up to 65% of total attention latency and disrupts the end-to-end integer dataflow critical for edge hardware efficiency. To address this limitation, we present IntAttention, the first fully integer, plug-and-play attention pipeline without retraining. At the core of our approach lies IndexSoftmax, a hardware-friendly operator that replaces floating-point exponentials entirely within the integer domain. IntAttention integrates sparsity-aware clipping, a 32-entry lookup-table approximation, and direct integer normalization, thereby eliminating all datatype conversion overhead. We evaluate IntAttention and demonstrate consistent and substantial gains. Our method achieves up to 3.7x speedup and 61% energy reduction over FP16 baselines and 2.0x faster than conventional INT8 attention pipelines on Armv8 CPUs. These gains are achieved with high-fidelity accuracy comparable to baselines across diverse language and vision models, enabling practical and efficient Transformer inference on commodity edge devices. Code will be released in later version of this work.

Abstract: Transformer-based models have become state-of-the-art tools in various machine learning tasks, including time series classification, yet their complexity makes understanding their internal decision-making challenging. Existing explainability methods often focus on input-output attributions, leaving the internal mechanisms largely opaque. This paper addresses this gap by adapting various Mechanistic Interpretability techniques; activation patching, attention saliency, and sparse autoencoders, from NLP to transformer architectures designed explicitly for time series classification. We systematically probe the internal causal roles of individual attention heads and timesteps, revealing causal structures within these models. Through experimentation on a benchmark time series dataset, we construct causal graphs illustrating how information propagates internally, highlighting key attention heads and temporal positions driving correct classifications. Additionally, we demonstrate the potential of sparse autoencoders for uncovering interpretable latent features. Our findings provide both methodological contributions to transformer interpretability and novel insights into the functional mechanics underlying transformer performance in time series classification tasks.

Abstract: Obtaining safety guarantees for reinforcement learning is a major challenge to achieve applicability for real-world tasks. Safety shields extend standard reinforcement learning and achieve hard safety guarantees. However, existing safety shields commonly use random sampling of safe actions or a fixed fallback controller, therefore disregarding future performance implications of different safe actions. In this work, we propose a predictive safety shield for model-based reinforcement learning agents in discrete space. Our safety shield updates the Q-function locally based on safe predictions, which originate from a safe simulation of the environment model. This shielding approach improves performance while maintaining hard safety guarantees. Our experiments on gridworld environments demonstrate that even short prediction horizons can be sufficient to identify the optimal path. We observe that our approach is robust to distribution shifts, e.g., between simulation and reality, without requiring additional training.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Real-world data, for example in climate applications, often consists of spatially gridded time series data or data with comparable structure. While the underlying system is often believed to behave similar at different points in space and time, those variations that do exist are twofold relevant: They often encode important information in and of themselves. And they may negatively affect the stability / convergence and reliability\Slash{}validity of results of algorithms assuming stationarity or space-translation invariance. We study the information encoded in changes of the causal graph, with stability in mind. An analysis of this general task identifies two core challenges. We develop guiding principles to overcome these challenges, and provide a framework realizing these principles by modifying constraint-based causal discovery approaches on the level of independence testing. This leads to an extremely modular, easily extensible and widely applicable framework. It can leverage existing constraint-based causal discovery methods (demonstrated on IID-algorithms PC, PC-stable, FCI and time series algorithms PCMCI, PCMCI+, LPCMCI) with little to no modification. The built-in modularity allows to systematically understand and improve upon an entire array of subproblems. By design, it can be extended by leveraging insights from change-point-detection, clustering, independence-testing and other well-studied related problems. The division into more accessible sub-problems also simplifies the understanding of fundamental limitations, hyperparameters controlling trade-offs and the statistical interpretation of results. An open-source implementation will be available soon.

Abstract: We consider the problem of strategic classification, where the act of deploying a classifier leads to strategic behaviour that induces a distribution shift on subsequent observations. Current approaches to learning classifiers in strategic settings are focused primarily on the linear setting, but in many cases non-linear classifiers are more suitable. A central limitation to progress for non-linear classifiers arises from the inability to compute best responses in these settings. We present a novel method for computing the best response by optimising the Lagrangian dual of the Agents' objective. We demonstrate that our method reproduces best responses in linear settings, identifying key weaknesses in existing approaches. We present further results demonstrating our method can be straight-forwardly applied to non-linear classifier settings, where it is useful for both evaluation and training.

Abstract: This study proposes a risk prediction method based on a Multi-Scale Temporal Alignment Network (MSTAN) to address the challenges of temporal irregularity, sampling interval differences, and multi-scale dynamic dependencies in Electronic Health Records (EHR). The method focuses on temporal feature modeling by introducing a learnable temporal alignment mechanism and a multi-scale convolutional feature extraction structure to jointly model long-term trends and short-term fluctuations in EHR sequences. At the input level, the model maps multi-source clinical features into a unified high-dimensional semantic space and employs temporal embedding and alignment modules to dynamically weight irregularly sampled data, reducing the impact of temporal distribution differences on model performance. The multi-scale feature extraction module then captures key patterns across different temporal granularities through multi-layer convolution and hierarchical fusion, achieving a fine-grained representation of patient states. Finally, an attention-based aggregation mechanism integrates global temporal dependencies to generate individual-level risk representations for disease risk prediction and health status assessment. Experiments conducted on publicly available EHR datasets show that the proposed model outperforms mainstream baselines in accuracy, recall, precision, and F1-Score, demonstrating the effectiveness and robustness of multi-scale temporal alignment in complex medical time-series analysis. This study provides a new solution for intelligent representation of high-dimensional asynchronous medical sequences and offers important technical support for EHR-driven clinical risk prediction.

Abstract: Cyclic peptides are promising modalities for targeting intracellular sites; however, cell-membrane permeability remains a key bottleneck, exacerbated by limited public data and the need for well-calibrated uncertainty. Instead of relying on data-eager complex deep learning architecture, we propose a monomer-aware decoupled global alignment kernel (MD-GAK), which couples chemically meaningful residue-residue similarity with sequence alignment while decoupling local matches from gap penalties. MD-GAK is a relatively simple kernel. To further demonstrate the robustness of our framework, we also introduce a variant, PMD-GAK, which incorporates a triangular positional prior. As we will show in the experimental section, PMD-GAK can offer additional advantages over MD-GAK, particularly in reducing calibration errors. Since our focus is on uncertainty estimation, we use Gaussian Processes as the predictive model, as both MD-GAK and PMD-GAK can be directly applied within this framework. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our methods through an extensive set of experiments, comparing our fully reproducible approach against state-of-the-art models, and show that it outperforms them across all metrics.

Abstract: Smart grids are a fusion of classical power infrastructure and advanced communication networks and smart control, to create a cyber-physical environment that is more efficient and flexible than ever before. This integration causes vulnerabilities that can undermine grid stability as well as reliability. Digital forensics is a fundamental concept of learning and identifying, detecting, and mitigating such security incidents. This paper presents an all-in-one machine learning-based digital forensic framework of smart grid systems deployed on the Cloud. The framework combines the data acquisition at the sensor-level, authenticated communication, scalable cloud storage and automated forensic analytics. The model uses supervised and unsupervised learning algorithms - such as Random Forest, Support Vector Machine, Gradient Boosted Trees and deep neural architectures for anomaly detection, event reconstruction and intrusion analysis in real time. After several simulation and experimental studies on real-time smart-meter data streams, the proposed framework is shown to be very accurate, scalable and resilient to cyber-attacks including data tampering, false-data injection and coordinated control-loop manipulation. The results indicate that cloud services are the best backbone for big-data-driven forensic workflows, which allows energy utilities to achieve a fast situational awareness and intelligent incident response.
