Abstract: We introduce iFlyBot-VLA, a large-scale Vision-Language-Action (VLA) model
trained under a novel framework. The main contributions are listed as follows:
(1) a latent action model thoroughly trained on large-scale human and robotic
manipulation videos; (2) a dual-level action representation framework that
jointly supervises both the Vision-Language Model (VLM) and the action expert
during training; (3) a mixed training strategy that combines robot trajectory
data with general QA and spatial QA datasets, effectively enhancing the 3D
perceptual and reasoning capabilities of the VLM backbone. Specifically, the
VLM is trained to predict two complementary forms of actions: latent actions,
derived from our latent action model pretrained on cross-embodiment
manipulation data, which capture implicit high-level intentions; and structured
discrete action tokens, obtained through frequency-domain transformations of
continuous control signals, which encode explicit low-level dynamics. This dual
supervision aligns the representation spaces of language, vision, and action,
enabling the VLM to directly contribute to action generation. Experimental
results on the LIBERO Franka benchmark demonstrate the superiority of our
frame-work, while real-world evaluations further show that iFlyBot-VLA achieves
competitive success rates across diverse and challenging manipulation tasks.
Furthermore, we plan to open-source a portion of our self-constructed dataset
to support future research in the community

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Purpose: This study provides the first comprehensive evaluation of foundation
models in fetal ultrasound (US) imaging under low inter-class variability
conditions. While recent vision foundation models such as DINOv3 have shown
remarkable transferability across medical domains, their ability to
discriminate anatomically similar structures has not been systematically
investigated. We address this gap by focusing on fetal brain standard
planes--transthalamic (TT), transventricular (TV), and transcerebellar
(TC)--which exhibit highly overlapping anatomical features and pose a critical
challenge for reliable biometric assessment.
  Methods: To ensure a fair and reproducible evaluation, all publicly available
fetal ultrasound datasets were curated and aggregated into a unified
multicenter benchmark, FetalUS-188K, comprising more than 188,000 annotated
images from heterogeneous acquisition settings. DINOv3 was pretrained in a
self-supervised manner to learn ultrasound-aware representations. The learned
features were then evaluated through standardized adaptation protocols,
including linear probing with frozen backbone and full fine-tuning, under two
initialization schemes: (i) pretraining on FetalUS-188K and (ii) initialization
from natural-image DINOv3 weights.
  Results: Models pretrained on fetal ultrasound data consistently outperformed
those initialized on natural images, with weighted F1-score improvements of up
to 20 percent. Domain-adaptive pretraining enabled the network to preserve
subtle echogenic and structural cues crucial for distinguishing intermediate
planes such as TV.
  Conclusion: Results demonstrate that generic foundation models fail to
generalize under low inter-class variability, whereas domain-specific
pretraining is essential to achieve robust and clinically reliable
representations in fetal brain ultrasound imaging.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Geo-Foundational Models (GFMs) enable fast and reliable extraction of
spatiotemporal information from satellite imagery, improving flood inundation
mapping by leveraging location and time embeddings. Despite their potential, it
remains unclear whether GFMs outperform traditional models like U-Net. A
systematic comparison across sensors and data availability scenarios is still
lacking, which is an essential step to guide end-users in model selection. To
address this, we evaluate three GFMs, Prithvi 2.0, Clay V1.5, DOFA, and UViT (a
Prithvi variant), against TransNorm, U-Net, and Attention U-Net using
PlanetScope, Sentinel-1, and Sentinel-2. We observe competitive performance
among all GFMs, with only 2-5% variation between the best and worst models
across sensors. Clay outperforms others on PlanetScope (0.79 mIoU) and
Sentinel-2 (0.70), while Prithvi leads on Sentinel-1 (0.57). In
leave-one-region-out cross-validation across five regions, Clay shows slightly
better performance across all sensors (mIoU: 0.72(0.04), 0.66(0.07),
0.51(0.08)) compared to Prithvi (0.70(0.05), 0.64(0.09), 0.49(0.13)) and DOFA
(0.67(0.07), 0.64(0.04), 0.49(0.09)) for PlanetScope, Sentinel-2, and
Sentinel-1, respectively. Across all 19 sites, leave-one-region-out
cross-validation reveals a 4% improvement by Clay compared to U-Net. Visual
inspection highlights Clay's superior ability to retain fine details. Few-shot
experiments show Clay achieves 0.64 mIoU on PlanetScope with just five training
images, outperforming Prithvi (0.24) and DOFA (0.35). In terms of computational
time, Clay is a better choice due to its smaller model size (26M parameters),
making it ~3x faster than Prithvi (650M) and 2x faster than DOFA (410M).
Contrary to previous findings, our results suggest GFMs offer small to moderate
improvements in flood mapping accuracy at lower computational cost and labeling
effort compared to traditional U-Net.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: We address the problem of image reconstruction from incomplete measurements,
encompassing both upsampling and inpainting, within a learning-based framework.
Conventional supervised approaches require fully sampled ground truth data,
while self-supervised methods allow incomplete ground truth but typically rely
on random sampling that, in expectation, covers the entire image. In contrast,
we consider fixed, deterministic sampling patterns with inherently incomplete
coverage, even in expectation. To overcome this limitation, we exploit multiple
invariances of the underlying image distribution, which theoretically allows us
to achieve the same reconstruction performance as fully supervised approaches.
We validate our method on optical-resolution image upsampling in photoacoustic
microscopy (PAM), demonstrating competitive or superior results while requiring
substantially less ground truth data.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: The detection of Protected Health Information (PHI) in medical imaging is
critical for safeguarding patient privacy and ensuring compliance with
regulatory frameworks. Traditional detection methodologies predominantly
utilize Optical Character Recognition (OCR) models in conjunction with named
entity recognition. However, recent advancements in Large Multimodal Model
(LMM) present new opportunities for enhanced text extraction and semantic
analysis. In this study, we systematically benchmark three prominent closed and
open-sourced LMMs, namely GPT-4o, Gemini 2.5 Flash, and Qwen 2.5 7B, utilizing
two distinct pipeline configurations: one dedicated to text analysis alone and
another integrating both OCR and semantic analysis. Our results indicate that
LMM exhibits superior OCR efficacy (WER: 0.03-0.05, CER: 0.02-0.03) compared to
conventional models like EasyOCR. However, this improvement in OCR performance
does not consistently correlate with enhanced overall PHI detection accuracy.
The strongest performance gains are observed on test cases with complex imprint
patterns. In scenarios where text regions are well readable with sufficient
contrast, and strong LMMs are employed for text analysis after OCR, different
pipeline configurations yield similar results. Furthermore, we provide
empirically grounded recommendations for LMM selection tailored to specific
operational constraints and propose a deployment strategy that leverages
scalable and modular infrastructure.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Tracking strength-demanding activities with wearable sensors like IMUs is
crucial for monitoring muscular strength, endurance, and power. However, there
is a lack of comprehensive datasets capturing these activities. To fill this
gap, we introduce \textit{StrengthSense}, an open dataset that encompasses IMU
signals capturing 11 strength-demanding activities, such as sit-to-stand,
climbing stairs, and mopping. For comparative purposes, the dataset also
includes 2 non-strength demanding activities. The dataset was collected from 29
healthy subjects utilizing 10 IMUs placed on limbs and the torso, and was
annotated using video recordings as references. This paper provides a
comprehensive overview of the data collection, pre-processing, and technical
validation. We conducted a comparative analysis between the joint angles
estimated by IMUs and those directly extracted from video to verify the
accuracy and reliability of the sensor data. Researchers and developers can
utilize \textit{StrengthSense} to advance the development of human activity
recognition algorithms, create fitness and health monitoring applications, and
more.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Creation of large-scale databases for Visual Question Answering tasks
pertaining to the text data in a scene (text-VQA) involves skilful human
annotation, which is tedious and challenging. With the advent of foundation
models that handle vision and language modalities, and with the maturity of OCR
systems, it is the need of the hour to establish an end-to-end pipeline that
can synthesize Question-Answer (QA) pairs based on scene-text from a given
image. We propose a pipeline for automated synthesis for text-VQA dataset that
can produce faithful QA pairs, and which scales up with the availability of
scene text data. Our proposed method harnesses the capabilities of multiple
models and algorithms involving OCR detection and recognition (text spotting),
region of interest (ROI) detection, caption generation, and question
generation. These components are streamlined into a cohesive pipeline to
automate the synthesis and validation of QA pairs. To the best of our
knowledge, this is the first pipeline proposed to automatically synthesize and
validate a large-scale text-VQA dataset comprising around 72K QA pairs based on
around 44K images.

Abstract: Purpose: In this paper, we develop and clinically evaluate a depth-only,
markerless augmented reality (AR) registration pipeline on a head-mounted
display, and assess accuracy across small or low-curvature anatomies in
real-life operative settings. Methods: On HoloLens 2, we align Articulated HAnd
Tracking (AHAT) depth to Computed Tomography (CT)-derived skin meshes via (i)
depth-bias correction, (ii) brief human-in-the-loop initialization, (iii)
global and local registration. We validated the surface-tracing error metric by
comparing "skin-to-bone" relative distances to CT ground truth on leg and foot
models, using an AR-tracked tool. We then performed seven intraoperative target
trials (feet x2, ear x3, leg x2) during the initial stage of fibula free-flap
harvest and mandibular reconstruction surgery, and collected 500+ data per
trial. Results: Preclinical validation showed tight agreement between AR-traced
and CT distances (leg: median |Delta d| 0.78 mm, RMSE 0.97 mm; feet: 0.80 mm,
1.20 mm). Clinically, per-point error had a median of 3.9 mm. Median errors by
anatomy were 3.2 mm (feet), 4.3 mm (ear), and 5.3 mm (lower leg), with 5 mm
coverage 92-95%, 84-90%, and 72-86%, respectively. Feet vs. lower leg differed
significantly (Delta median ~1.1 mm; p < 0.001). Conclusion: A depth-only,
markerless AR pipeline on HMDs achieved ~3-4 mm median error across feet, ear,
and lower leg in live surgical settings without fiducials, approaching typical
clinical error thresholds for moderate-risk tasks. Human-guided initialization
plus global-to-local registration enabled accurate alignment on small or
low-curvature targets, improving the clinical readiness of markerless AR
guidance.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Planktonic foraminifera, marine protists characterized by their intricate
chambered shells, serve as valuable indicators of past and present
environmental conditions. Understanding their chamber growth trajectory
provides crucial insights into organismal development and ecological adaptation
under changing environments. However, automated tracing of chamber growth from
imaging data remains largely unexplored, with existing approaches relying
heavily on manual segmentation of each chamber, which is time-consuming and
subjective. In this study, we propose an end-to-end pipeline that integrates
instance segmentation, a computer vision technique not extensively explored in
foraminifera, with a dedicated chamber ordering algorithm to automatically
reconstruct three-dimensional growth trajectories from high-resolution computed
tomography scans. We quantitatively and qualitatively evaluate multiple
instance segmentation methods, each optimized for distinct spatial features of
the chambers, and examine their downstream influence on growth-order
reconstruction accuracy. Experimental results on expert-annotated datasets
demonstrate that the proposed pipeline substantially reduces manual effort
while maintaining biologically meaningful accuracy. Although segmentation
models exhibit under-segmentation in smaller chambers due to reduced voxel
fidelity and subtle inter-chamber connectivity, the chamber-ordering algorithm
remains robust, achieving consistent reconstruction of developmental
trajectories even under partial segmentation. This work provides the first
fully automated and reproducible pipeline for digital foraminiferal growth
analysis, establishing a foundation for large-scale, data-driven ecological
studies.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Accurate quantification of pavement crack width plays a pivotal role in
assessing structural integrity and guiding maintenance interventions. However,
achieving precise crack width measurements presents significant challenges due
to: (1) the complex, non-uniform morphology of crack boundaries, which limits
the efficacy of conventional approaches, and (2) the demand for rapid
measurement capabilities from arbitrary pixel locations to facilitate
comprehensive pavement condition evaluation. To overcome these limitations,
this study introduces a cascaded framework integrating Principal Component
Analysis (PCA) and Robust PCA (RPCA) for efficient crack width extraction from
digital images. The proposed methodology comprises three sequential stages: (1)
initial crack segmentation using established detection algorithms to generate a
binary representation, (2) determination of the primary orientation axis for
quasi-parallel cracks through PCA, and (3) extraction of the Main Propagation
Axis (MPA) for irregular crack geometries using RPCA. Comprehensive evaluations
were conducted across three publicly available datasets, demonstrating that the
proposed approach achieves superior performance in both computational
efficiency and measurement accuracy compared to existing state-of-the-art
techniques.

Abstract: Understanding and mitigating flicker effects caused by rapid variations in
light intensity is critical for enhancing the performance of event cameras in
diverse environments. This paper introduces an innovative autonomous mechanism
for tuning the biases of event cameras, effectively addressing flicker across a
wide frequency range -25 Hz to 500 Hz. Unlike traditional methods that rely on
additional hardware or software for flicker filtering, our approach leverages
the event cameras inherent bias settings. Utilizing a simple Convolutional
Neural Networks -CNNs, the system identifies instances of flicker in a spatial
space and dynamically adjusts specific biases to minimize its impact. The
efficacy of this autobiasing system was robustly tested using a face detector
framework under both well-lit and low-light conditions, as well as across
various frequencies. The results demonstrated significant improvements:
enhanced YOLO confidence metrics for face detection, and an increased
percentage of frames capturing detected faces. Moreover, the average gradient,
which serves as an indicator of flicker presence through edge detection,
decreased by 38.2 percent in well-lit conditions and by 53.6 percent in
low-light conditions. These findings underscore the potential of our approach
to significantly improve the functionality of event cameras in a range of
adverse lighting scenarios.

Abstract: In this technical report, we introduce a framework to address Grounded Video
Question Answering (GVQA) task for the ICCV 2025 Perception Test Challenge. The
GVQA task demands robust multimodal models capable of complex reasoning over
video content, grounding the resulting answers visually, and tracking the
referenced objects temporally. To achieve this capability, our proposed
approach decomposes the GVQA task into a three-stage pipeline: (1) Video
Reasoning \& QA, (2) Spatio-temporal Grounding and (3) Tracking. Our key
contribution is the introduction of a trigger moment, derived from our proposed
CORTEX prompt, which pinpoints the single most visible frame of a target object
to serve as a robust anchor for grounding and tracking. To this end, we achieve
the HOTA score of 0.4968, which marks a significant improvement over the
previous year's winning score of 0.2704 on GVQA task.

Abstract: Accurate detection of retinal vessels plays a critical role in reflecting a
wide range of health status indicators in the clinical diagnosis of ocular
diseases. Recently, advances in deep learning have led to a surge in retinal
vessel segmentation methods, which have significantly contributed to the
quantitative analysis of vascular morphology. However, retinal vasculature
differs significantly from conventional segmentation targets in that it
consists of extremely thin and branching structures, whose global morphology
varies greatly across images. These characteristics continue to pose challenges
to segmentation precision and robustness. To address these issues, we propose
MM-UNet, a novel architecture tailored for efficient retinal vessel
segmentation. The model incorporates Morph Mamba Convolution layers, which
replace pointwise convolutions to enhance branching topological perception
through morph, state-aware feature sampling. Additionally, Reverse Selective
State Guidance modules integrate reverse guidance theory with state-space
modeling to improve geometric boundary awareness and decoding efficiency.
Extensive experiments conducted on two public retinal vessel segmentation
datasets demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed method in
segmentation accuracy. Compared to the existing approaches, MM-UNet achieves
F1-score gains of 1.64 $\%$ on DRIVE and 1.25 $\%$ on STARE, demonstrating its
effectiveness and advancement. The project code is public via

Abstract: Background: Alzheimer's disease (AD) diagnosis heavily relies on amyloid-beta
positron emission tomography (Abeta-PET), which is limited by high cost and
limited accessibility. This study explores whether Abeta-PET spatial patterns
can be predicted from blood-based biomarkers (BBMs) and MRI scans. Methods: We
collected Abeta-PET images, T1-weighted MRI scans, and BBMs from 566
participants. A language-enhanced generative model, driven by a large language
model (LLM) and multimodal information fusion, was developed to synthesize PET
images. Synthesized images were evaluated for image quality, diagnostic
consistency, and clinical applicability within a fully automated diagnostic
pipeline. Findings: The synthetic PET images closely resemble real PET scans in
both structural details (SSIM = 0.920 +/- 0.003) and regional patterns
(Pearson's r = 0.955 +/- 0.007). Diagnostic outcomes using synthetic PET show
high agreement with real PET-based diagnoses (accuracy = 0.80). Using synthetic
PET, we developed a fully automatic AD diagnostic pipeline integrating PET
synthesis and classification. The synthetic PET-based model (AUC = 0.78)
outperforms T1-based (AUC = 0.68) and BBM-based (AUC = 0.73) models, while
combining synthetic PET and BBMs further improved performance (AUC = 0.79).
Ablation analysis supports the advantages of LLM integration and prompt
engineering. Interpretation: Our language-enhanced generative model synthesizes
realistic PET images, enhancing the utility of MRI and BBMs for Abeta spatial
pattern assessment and improving the diagnostic workflow for Alzheimer's
disease.

Abstract: Strawberries are among the most economically significant fruits in the United
States, generating over $2 billion in annual farm-gate sales and accounting for
approximately 13% of the total fruit production value. Plant phenotyping plays
a vital role in selecting superior cultivars by characterizing plant traits
such as morphology, canopy structure, and growth dynamics. However, traditional
plant phenotyping methods are time-consuming, labor-intensive, and often
destructive. Recently, neural rendering techniques, notably Neural Radiance
Fields (NeRF) and 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS), have emerged as powerful
frameworks for high-fidelity 3D reconstruction. By capturing a sequence of
multi-view images or videos around a target plant, these methods enable
non-destructive reconstruction of complex plant architectures. Despite their
promise, most current applications of 3DGS in agricultural domains reconstruct
the entire scene, including background elements, which introduces noise,
increases computational costs, and complicates downstream trait analysis. To
address this limitation, we propose a novel object-centric 3D reconstruction
framework incorporating a preprocessing pipeline that leverages the Segment
Anything Model v2 (SAM-2) and alpha channel background masking to achieve clean
strawberry plant reconstructions. This approach produces more accurate
geometric representations while substantially reducing computational time. With
a background-free reconstruction, our algorithm can automatically estimate
important plant traits, such as plant height and canopy width, using DBSCAN
clustering and Principal Component Analysis (PCA). Experimental results show
that our method outperforms conventional pipelines in both accuracy and
efficiency, offering a scalable and non-destructive solution for strawberry
plant phenotyping.

Abstract: Segmental longitudinal strain (SLS) of the left ventricle (LV) is an
important prognostic indicator for evaluating regional LV dysfunction, in
particular for diagnosing and managing myocardial ischemia. Current techniques
for strain estimation require significant manual intervention and expertise,
limiting their efficiency and making them too resource-intensive for monitoring
purposes. This study introduces the first automated pipeline, autoStrain, for
SLS estimation in transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) using deep learning
(DL) methods for motion estimation. We present a comparative analysis of two DL
approaches: TeeFlow, based on the RAFT optical flow model for dense
frame-to-frame predictions, and TeeTracker, based on the CoTracker point
trajectory model for sparse long-sequence predictions.
  As ground truth motion data from real echocardiographic sequences are hardly
accessible, we took advantage of a unique simulation pipeline (SIMUS) to
generate a highly realistic synthetic TEE (synTEE) dataset of 80 patients with
ground truth myocardial motion to train and evaluate both models. Our
evaluation shows that TeeTracker outperforms TeeFlow in accuracy, achieving a
mean distance error in motion estimation of 0.65 mm on a synTEE test dataset.
  Clinical validation on 16 patients further demonstrated that SLS estimation
with our autoStrain pipeline aligned with clinical references, achieving a mean
difference (95\% limits of agreement) of 1.09% (-8.90% to 11.09%).
Incorporation of simulated ischemia in the synTEE data improved the accuracy of
the models in quantifying abnormal deformation. Our findings indicate that
integrating AI-driven motion estimation with TEE can significantly enhance the
precision and efficiency of cardiac function assessment in clinical settings.

Abstract: Mobile sensing systems have long faced a fundamental trade-off between
sensing quality and efficiency due to constraints in computation, power, and
other limitations. Sparse sensing, which aims to acquire and process only a
subset of sensor data, has been a key strategy for maintaining performance
under such constraints. However, existing sparse sensing methods often suffer
from reduced accuracy, as missing information across space and time introduces
uncertainty into many sensing systems. In this work, we investigate whether
foundation models can change the landscape of mobile sparse sensing. Using
real-world mobile AR data, our evaluations demonstrate that foundation models
offer significant improvements in geometry-aware image warping, a central
technique for enabling accurate reuse of cross-frame information. Furthermore,
our study demonstrates the scalability of foundation model-based sparse sensing
and shows its leading performance in 3D scene reconstruction. Collectively, our
study reveals critical aspects of the promises and the open challenges of
integrating foundation models into mobile sparse sensing systems.

Abstract: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most prevalent form of dementia, and its
early diagnosis is essential for slowing disease progression. Recent studies on
multimodal neuroimaging fusion using MRI and PET have achieved promising
results by integrating multi-scale complementary features. However, most
existing approaches primarily emphasize cross-modal complementarity while
overlooking the diagnostic importance of modality-specific features. In
addition, the inherent distributional differences between modalities often lead
to biased and noisy representations, degrading classification performance. To
address these challenges, we propose a Collaborative Attention and
Consistent-Guided Fusion framework for MRI and PET based AD diagnosis. The
proposed model introduces a learnable parameter representation (LPR) block to
compensate for missing modality information, followed by a shared encoder and
modality-independent encoders to preserve both shared and specific
representations. Furthermore, a consistency-guided mechanism is employed to
explicitly align the latent distributions across modalities. Experimental
results on the ADNI dataset demonstrate that our method achieves superior
diagnostic performance compared with existing fusion strategies.

Abstract: Monocular depth estimation (MDE) is a critical task to guide autonomous
medical robots. However, obtaining absolute (metric) depth from an endoscopy
camera in surgical scenes is difficult, which limits supervised learning of
depth on real endoscopic images. Current image-level unsupervised domain
adaptation methods translate synthetic images with known depth maps into the
style of real endoscopic frames and train depth networks using these translated
images with their corresponding depth maps. However a domain gap often remains
between real and translated synthetic images. In this paper, we present a
latent feature alignment method to improve absolute depth estimation by
reducing this domain gap in the context of endoscopic videos of the central
airway. Our methods are agnostic to the image translation process and focus on
the depth estimation itself. Specifically, the depth network takes translated
synthetic and real endoscopic frames as input and learns latent
domain-invariant features via adversarial learning and directional feature
consistency. The evaluation is conducted on endoscopic videos of central airway
phantoms with manually aligned absolute depth maps. Compared to
state-of-the-art MDE methods, our approach achieves superior performance on
both absolute and relative depth metrics, and consistently improves results
across various backbones and pretrained weights. Our code is available at

Abstract: Medical Report Generation (MRG) is a key part of modern medical diagnostics,
as it automatically generates reports from radiological images to reduce
radiologists' burden. However, reliable MRG models for lesion description face
three main challenges: insufficient domain knowledge understanding, poor
text-visual entity embedding alignment, and spurious correlations from
cross-modal biases. Previous work only addresses single challenges, while this
paper tackles all three via a novel hierarchical task decomposition approach,
proposing the HTSC-CIF framework. HTSC-CIF classifies the three challenges into
low-, mid-, and high-level tasks: 1) Low-level: align medical entity features
with spatial locations to enhance domain knowledge for visual encoders; 2)
Mid-level: use Prefix Language Modeling (text) and Masked Image Modeling
(images) to boost cross-modal alignment via mutual guidance; 3) High-level: a
cross-modal causal intervention module (via front-door intervention) to reduce
confounders and improve interpretability. Extensive experiments confirm
HTSC-CIF's effectiveness, significantly outperforming state-of-the-art (SOTA)
MRG methods. Code will be made public upon paper acceptance.

Abstract: Object pose estimation is a task that is of central importance in 3D Computer
Vision. Given a target image and a canonical pose, a single point estimate may
very often be sufficient; however, a probabilistic pose output is related to a
number of benefits when pose is not unambiguous due to sensor and projection
constraints or inherent object symmetries. With this paper, we explore the
usefulness of using the well-known Euler angles parameterisation as a basis for
a Normalizing Flows model for pose estimation. Isomorphic to spatial rotation,
3D pose has been parameterized in a number of ways, either in or out of the
context of parameter estimation. We explore the idea that Euler angles, despite
their shortcomings, may lead to useful models in a number of aspects, compared
to a model built on a more complex parameterisation.

Abstract: We introduce SAIL-RL, a reinforcement learning (RL) post-training framework
that enhances the reasoning capabilities of multimodal large language models
(MLLMs) by teaching them when and how to think. Existing approaches are limited
by outcome-only supervision, which rewards correct answers without ensuring
sound reasoning, and by uniform thinking strategies, which often lead to
overthinking on simple tasks and underthinking on complex ones. SAIL-RL
addresses these challenges with a dual reward system: the Thinking Reward,
which evaluates reasoning quality through factual grounding, logical coherence,
and answer consistency, and the Judging Reward, which adaptively determines
whether deep reasoning or direct answering is appropriate. Experiments on the
state-of-the-art SAIL-VL2 show that SAIL-RL improves reasoning and multimodal
understanding benchmarks at both 4B and 8B scales, achieving competitive
performance against commercial closed-source models such as GPT-4o, and
substantially reduces hallucinations, establishing it as a principled framework
for building more reliable and adaptive MLLMs. The code will be available at

Abstract: We propose a Graph Neural Network (GNN)-based approach for Handwritten
Mathematical Expression (HME) recognition by modeling HMEs as graphs, where
nodes represent symbols and edges capture spatial dependencies. A deep BLSTM
network is used for symbol segmentation, recognition, and spatial relation
classification, forming an initial primitive graph. A 2D-CFG parser then
generates all possible spatial relations, while the GNN-based link prediction
model refines the structure by removing unnecessary connections, ultimately
forming the Symbol Label Graph. Experimental results demonstrate the
effectiveness of our approach, showing promising performance in HME structure
recognition.

Abstract: We introduce Cycle-Sync, a robust and global framework for estimating camera
poses (both rotations and locations). Our core innovation is a location solver
that adapts message-passing least squares (MPLS) -- originally developed for
group synchronization -- to camera location estimation. We modify MPLS to
emphasize cycle-consistent information, redefine cycle consistencies using
estimated distances from previous iterations, and incorporate a Welsch-type
robust loss. We establish the strongest known deterministic exact-recovery
guarantee for camera location estimation, showing that cycle consistency alone
-- without access to inter-camera distances -- suffices to achieve the lowest
sample complexity currently known. To further enhance robustness, we introduce
a plug-and-play outlier rejection module inspired by robust subspace recovery,
and we fully integrate cycle consistency into MPLS for rotation
synchronization. Our global approach avoids the need for bundle adjustment.
Experiments on synthetic and real datasets show that Cycle-Sync consistently
outperforms leading pose estimators, including full structure-from-motion
pipelines with bundle adjustment.

Abstract: Out-of-distribution (OOD) detection is paramount to ensuring the reliability
and robustness of learning models in real-world applications. Existing post-hoc
OOD detection methods detect OOD samples by leveraging their features and
logits information without retraining. However, they often overlook the
inherent correlation between features and logits, which is crucial for
effective OOD detection. To address this limitation, we propose Global-Aware
Feature Decoupling with Confidence Calibration (GAFD-CC). GAFD-CC aims to
refine decision boundaries and increase discriminative performance. Firstly, it
performs global-aware feature decoupling guided by classification weights. This
involves aligning features with the direction of global classification weights
to decouple them. From this, GAFD-CC extracts two types of critical
information: positively correlated features that promote in-distribution
(ID)/OOD boundary refinement and negatively correlated features that suppress
false positives and tighten these boundaries. Secondly, it adaptively fuses
these decoupled features with multi-scale logit-based confidence for
comprehensive and robust OOD detection. Extensive experiments on large-scale
benchmarks demonstrate GAFD-CC's competitive performance and strong
generalization ability compared to those of state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: In human cognition, there exist numerous thought processes that are tacit and
beyond verbal expression, enabling us to understand and interact with the world
in multiple ways. However, contemporary Vision-Language Models (VLMs) remain
constrained to reasoning within the discrete and rigid space of linguistic
tokens, thereby bottlenecking the rich, high-dimensional nature of visual
perception. To bridge this gap, we propose CoCoVa (Chain of Continuous
Vision-Language Thought), a novel framework for vision-language model that
leverages continuous cross-modal reasoning for diverse vision-language tasks.
The core of CoCoVa is an iterative reasoning cycle, where a novel Latent
Q-Former (LQ-Former) acts as a dynamic reasoning engine, iteratively refining a
chain of latent thought vectors through cross-modal fusion. To focus this
process, a token selection mechanism dynamically identifies salient visual
regions, mimicking attentional focus. To ensure these latent thoughts remain
grounded, we train the model with a multi-task objective that combines
contrastive learning and diffusion-based reconstruction, enforcing alignment
between latent representations and both visual and textual modalities.
Evaluations show CoCoVa improves accuracy and token efficiency over strong
baselines. With a 1.5B backbone, it competes with or surpasses larger 7B-9B
models on almost all benchmarks. When scaled to 7B LLM backbones, it remains
competitive with state-of-the-art models. Qualitative analysis validates that
learned latent space captures interpretable and structured reasoning patterns,
highlighting the potential of CoCoVa to bridge the representational gap between
discrete language processing and the continuous nature of visual understanding.

Abstract: Large-scale chemical reaction datasets are crucial for AI research in
chemistry. However, existing chemical reaction data often exist as images
within papers, making them not machine-readable and unusable for training
machine learning models. In response to this challenge, we propose the
RxnCaption framework for the task of chemical Reaction Diagram Parsing (RxnDP).
Our framework reformulates the traditional coordinate prediction driven parsing
process into an image captioning problem, which Large Vision-Language Models
(LVLMs) handle naturally. We introduce a strategy termed "BBox and Index as
Visual Prompt" (BIVP), which uses our state-of-the-art molecular detector,
MolYOLO, to pre-draw molecular bounding boxes and indices directly onto the
input image. This turns the downstream parsing into a natural-language
description problem. Extensive experiments show that the BIVP strategy
significantly improves structural extraction quality while simplifying model
design. We further construct the RxnCaption-11k dataset, an order of magnitude
larger than prior real-world literature benchmarks, with a balanced test subset
across four layout archetypes. Experiments demonstrate that RxnCaption-VL
achieves state-of-the-art performance on multiple metrics. We believe our
method, dataset, and models will advance structured information extraction from
chemical literature and catalyze broader AI applications in chemistry. We will
release data, models, and code on GitHub.

Abstract: Moving object segmentation is a crucial task for safe and reliable autonomous
mobile systems like self-driving cars, improving the reliability and robustness
of subsequent tasks like SLAM or path planning. While the segmentation of
camera or LiDAR data is widely researched and achieves great results, it often
introduces an increased latency by requiring the accumulation of temporal
sequences to gain the necessary temporal context. Radar sensors overcome this
problem with their ability to provide a direct measurement of a point's Doppler
velocity, which can be exploited for single-scan moving object segmentation.
However, radar point clouds are often sparse and noisy, making data annotation
for use in supervised learning very tedious, time-consuming, and
cost-intensive. To overcome this problem, we address the task of
self-supervised moving object segmentation of sparse and noisy radar point
clouds. We follow a two-step approach of contrastive self-supervised
representation learning with subsequent supervised fine-tuning using limited
amounts of annotated data. We propose a novel clustering-based contrastive loss
function with cluster refinement based on dynamic points removal to pretrain
the network to produce motion-aware representations of the radar data. Our
method improves label efficiency after fine-tuning, effectively boosting
state-of-the-art performance by self-supervised pretraining.

Abstract: Color consistency correction for color point clouds is a fundamental yet
important task in 3D rendering and compression applications. In the past, most
previous color correction methods aimed at correcting color for color images.
The purpose of this paper is to propose a grouping-based hybrid color
correction algorithm for color point clouds. Our algorithm begins by estimating
the overlapping rate between the aligned source and target point clouds, and
then adaptively partitions the target points into two groups, namely the close
proximity group Gcl and the moderate proximity group Gmod, or three groups,
namely Gcl, Gmod, and the distant proximity group Gdist, when the estimated
overlapping rate is low or high, respectively. To correct color for target
points in Gcl, a K-nearest neighbors based bilateral interpolation (KBI) method
is proposed. To correct color for target points in Gmod, a joint KBI and the
histogram equalization (JKHE) method is proposed. For target points in Gdist, a
histogram equalization (HE) method is proposed for color correction. Finally,
we discuss the grouping-effect free property and the ablation study in our
algorithm. The desired color consistency correction benefit of our algorithm
has been justified through 1086 testing color point cloud pairs against the
state-of-the-art methods. The C++ source code of our algorithm can be accessed
from the website: https://github.com/ivpml84079/Point-cloud-color-correction.

Abstract: Cats and humans differ in ocular anatomy. Most notably, Felis Catus (domestic
cats) have vertically elongated pupils linked to ambush predation; yet, how
such specializations manifest in downstream visual representations remains
incompletely understood. We present a unified, frozen-encoder benchmark that
quantifies feline-human cross-species representational alignment in the wild,
across convolutional networks, supervised Vision Transformers, windowed
transformers, and self-supervised ViTs (DINO), using layer-wise Centered Kernel
Alignment (linear and RBF) and Representational Similarity Analysis, with
additional distributional and stability tests reported in the paper. Across
models, DINO ViT-B/16 attains the most substantial alignment (mean CKA-RBF
$\approx0.814$, mean CKA-linear $\approx0.745$, mean RSA $\approx0.698$),
peaking at early blocks, indicating that token-level self-supervision induces
early-stage features that bridge species-specific statistics. Supervised ViTs
are competitive on CKA yet show weaker geometric correspondence than DINO
(e.g., ViT-B/16 RSA $\approx0.53$ at block8; ViT-L/16 $\approx0.47$ at
block14), revealing depth-dependent divergences between similarity and
representational geometry. CNNs remain strong baselines but below plain ViTs on
alignment, and windowed transformers underperform plain ViTs, implicating
architectural inductive biases in cross-species alignment. Results indicate
that self-supervision coupled with ViT inductive biases yields representational
geometries that more closely align feline and human visual systems than widely
used CNNs and windowed Transformers, providing testable neuroscientific
hypotheses about where and how cross-species visual computations converge. We
release our code and dataset for reference and reproducibility.

Abstract: We present IllumFlow, a novel framework that synergizes conditional Rectified
Flow (CRF) with Retinex theory for low-light image enhancement (LLIE). Our
model addresses low-light enhancement through separate optimization of
illumination and reflectance components, effectively handling both lighting
variations and noise. Specifically, we first decompose an input image into
reflectance and illumination components following Retinex theory. To model the
wide dynamic range of illumination variations in low-light images, we propose a
conditional rectified flow framework that represents illumination changes as a
continuous flow field. While complex noise primarily resides in the reflectance
component, we introduce a denoising network, enhanced by flow-derived data
augmentation, to remove reflectance noise and chromatic aberration while
preserving color fidelity. IllumFlow enables precise illumination adaptation
across lighting conditions while naturally supporting customizable brightness
enhancement. Extensive experiments on low-light enhancement and exposure
correction demonstrate superior quantitative and qualitative performance over
existing methods.

Abstract: Complex chart understanding tasks demand advanced visual recognition and
reasoning capabilities from multimodal large language models (MLLMs). However,
current research provides limited coverage of complex chart scenarios and
computation-intensive reasoning tasks prevalent in real-world applications.
This study proposes an automated multi-stage code-driven pipeline for
systematically generating visual reasoning datasets to address these
limitations. The pipeline integrates retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) to
retrieve professional chart templates and employs chain-of-thought (CoT)
strategies to generate reasoning codes that simulate real data distributions,
thereby driving chart rendering and question-related statistical computations.
Through model-based evaluation, the pipeline enhances chart diversity and data
quality. Using this framework, we construct ChartM$^3$, a multi-dimensional and
multi-step dataset containing 38K charts and 142K Q&A pairs for training, along
with 2,871 high-quality evaluation samples for enabling practical performance
assessment. Supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and reinforcement learning (RL)
experiments demonstrate that our dataset significantly improves reasoning
capabilities and cross-domain generalization performance, enabling smaller
models to achieve performance comparable to larger-scale models in complex
chart comprehension.

Abstract: Precise semantic segmentation of crops and weeds is necessary for
agricultural weeding robots. However, training deep learning models requires
large annotated datasets, which are costly to obtain in real fields. Synthetic
data can reduce this burden, but the gap between simulated and real images
remains a challenge. In this paper, we present a pipeline for procedural
generation of synthetic crop-weed images using Blender, producing annotated
datasets under diverse conditions of plant growth, weed density, lighting, and
camera angle. We benchmark several state-of-the-art segmentation models on
synthetic and real datasets and analyze their cross-domain generalization. Our
results show that training on synthetic images leads to a sim-to-real gap of
10%, surpassing previous state-of-the-art methods. Moreover, synthetic data
demonstrates good generalization properties, outperforming real datasets in
cross-domain scenarios. These findings highlight the potential of synthetic
agricultural datasets and support hybrid strategies for more efficient model
training.

Abstract: Video Understanding, Scene Interpretation and Commonsense Reasoning are
highly challenging tasks enabling the interpretation of visual information,
allowing agents to perceive, interact with and make rational decisions in its
environment. Large Language Models (LLMs) and Visual Language Models (VLMs)
have shown remarkable advancements in these areas in recent years, enabling
domain-specific applications as well as zero-shot open vocabulary tasks,
combining multiple domains. However, the required computational complexity

inference time. In this paper, we investigate the capabilities of
state-of-the-art VLMs for the task of Scene Interpretation and Action
Recognition, with special regard to small VLMs capable of being deployed to
edge devices in the context of Mobile Robotics. The proposed pipeline is
evaluated on a diverse dataset consisting of various real-world cityscape,

Abstract: Satellite image inpainting is a crucial task in remote sensing, where
accurately restoring missing or occluded regions is essential for robust image
analysis. In this paper, we propose KAO, a novel framework that utilizes
Kernel-Adaptive Optimization within diffusion models for satellite image
inpainting. KAO is specifically designed to address the challenges posed by
very high-resolution (VHR) satellite datasets, such as DeepGlobe and the
Massachusetts Roads Dataset. Unlike existing methods that rely on
preconditioned models requiring extensive retraining or postconditioned models
with significant computational overhead, KAO introduces a Latent Space
Conditioning approach, optimizing a compact latent space to achieve efficient
and accurate inpainting. Furthermore, we incorporate Explicit Propagation into
the diffusion process, facilitating forward-backward fusion, which improves the
stability and precision of the method. Experimental results demonstrate that
KAO sets a new benchmark for VHR satellite image restoration, providing a
scalable, high-performance solution that balances the efficiency of
preconditioned models with the flexibility of postconditioned models.

Abstract: Multi-view action recognition aims to recognize human actions using multiple
camera views and deals with occlusion caused by obstacles or crowds. In this
task, cooperation among views, which generates a joint representation by
combining multiple views, is vital. Previous studies have explored promising
cooperation methods for improving performance. However, since their methods
focus only on the task setting of recognizing a single action from an entire
video, they are not applicable to the recently popular spatio-temporal action
recognition~(STAR) setting, in which each person's action is recognized
sequentially. To address this problem, this paper proposes a multi-view action
recognition method for the STAR setting, called MVAFormer. In MVAFormer, we
introduce a novel transformer-based cooperation module among views. In contrast
to previous studies, which utilize embedding vectors with lost spatial
information, our module utilizes the feature map for effective cooperation in
the STAR setting, which preserves the spatial information. Furthermore, in our
module, we divide the self-attention for the same and different views to model
the relationship between multiple views effectively. The results of experiments
using a newly collected dataset demonstrate that MVAFormer outperforms the
comparison baselines by approximately $4.4$ points on the F-measure.

Abstract: We introduce OLATverse, a large-scale dataset comprising around 9M images of
765 real-world objects, captured from multiple viewpoints under a diverse set
of precisely controlled lighting conditions. While recent advances in
object-centric inverse rendering, novel view synthesis and relighting have
shown promising results, most techniques still heavily rely on the synthetic
datasets for training and small-scale real-world datasets for benchmarking,
which limits their realism and generalization. To address this gap, OLATverse
offers two key advantages over existing datasets: large-scale coverage of real
objects and high-fidelity appearance under precisely controlled illuminations.
Specifically, OLATverse contains 765 common and uncommon real-world objects,
spanning a wide range of material categories. Each object is captured using 35
DSLR cameras and 331 individually controlled light sources, enabling the
simulation of diverse illumination conditions. In addition, for each object, we
provide well-calibrated camera parameters, accurate object masks, photometric
surface normals, and diffuse albedo as auxiliary resources. We also construct
an extensive evaluation set, establishing the first comprehensive real-world
object-centric benchmark for inverse rendering and normal estimation. We
believe that OLATverse represents a pivotal step toward integrating the next
generation of inverse rendering and relighting methods with real-world data.
The full dataset, along with all post-processing workflows, will be publicly

Abstract: With the rapid growth of the low-altitude economy, UAVs have become crucial
for measurement and tracking in patrol systems. However, in GNSS-denied areas,
satellite-based localization methods are prone to failure. This paper presents
a cross-view UAV localization framework that performs map matching via object
detection, aimed at effectively addressing cross-temporal, cross-view,
heterogeneous aerial image matching. In typical pipelines, UAV visual
localization is formulated as an image-retrieval problem: features are
extracted to build a localization map, and the pose of a query image is
estimated by matching it to a reference database with known poses. Because
publicly available UAV localization datasets are limited, many approaches
recast localization as a classification task and rely on scene labels in these
datasets to ensure accuracy. Other methods seek to reduce cross-domain
differences using polar-coordinate reprojection, perspective transformations,
or generative adversarial networks; however, they can suffer from misalignment,
content loss, and limited realism. In contrast, we leverage modern object
detection to accurately extract salient instances from UAV and satellite
images, and integrate a graph neural network to reason about inter-image and
intra-image node relationships. Using a fine-grained, graph-based
node-similarity metric, our method achieves strong retrieval and localization
performance. Extensive experiments on public and real-world datasets show that
our approach handles heterogeneous appearance differences effectively and
generalizes well, making it applicable to scenarios with larger modality gaps,
such as infrared-visible image matching. Our dataset will be publicly available

Abstract: Recent advances in multi-modal models have demonstrated strong performance in
tasks such as image generation and reasoning. However, applying these models to
the fire domain remains challenging due to the lack of publicly available
datasets with high-quality fire domain annotations. To address this gap, we
introduce DetectiumFire, a large-scale, multi-modal dataset comprising of 22.5k
high-resolution fire-related images and 2.5k real-world fire-related videos
covering a wide range of fire types, environments, and risk levels. The data
are annotated with both traditional computer vision labels (e.g., bounding
boxes) and detailed textual prompts describing the scene, enabling applications
such as synthetic data generation and fire risk reasoning. DetectiumFire offers
clear advantages over existing benchmarks in scale, diversity, and data
quality, significantly reducing redundancy and enhancing coverage of real-world
scenarios. We validate the utility of DetectiumFire across multiple tasks,
including object detection, diffusion-based image generation, and
vision-language reasoning. Our results highlight the potential of this dataset
to advance fire-related research and support the development of intelligent
safety systems. We release DetectiumFire to promote broader exploration of fire
understanding in the AI community. The dataset is available at

Abstract: The automation of workflows in advanced microscopy is a key goal where
foundation models like Language Models (LLMs) and Vision-Language Models (VLMs)
show great potential. However, adapting these general-purpose models for
specialized scientific tasks is critical, and the optimal domain adaptation
strategy is often unclear. To address this, we introduce PtychoBench, a new
multi-modal, multi-task benchmark for ptychographic analysis. Using this
benchmark, we systematically compare two specialization strategies: Supervised
Fine-Tuning (SFT) and In-Context Learning (ICL). We evaluate these strategies
on a visual artifact detection task with VLMs and a textual parameter
recommendation task with LLMs in a data-scarce regime. Our findings reveal that
the optimal specialization pathway is task-dependent. For the visual task, SFT
and ICL are highly complementary, with a fine-tuned model guided by
context-aware examples achieving the highest mean performance (Micro-F1 of
0.728). Conversely, for the textual task, ICL on a large base model is the
superior strategy, reaching a peak Micro-F1 of 0.847 and outperforming a
powerful "super-expert" SFT model (0-shot Micro-F1 of 0.839). We also confirm
the superiority of context-aware prompting and identify a consistent contextual
interference phenomenon in fine-tuned models. These results, benchmarked
against strong baselines including GPT-4o and a DINOv3-based classifier, offer
key observations for AI in science: the optimal specialization path in our
benchmark is dependent on the task modality, offering a clear framework for
developing more effective science-based agentic systems.

Abstract: Recent advancements in Deep Learning enable hardware-based cognitive systems,
that is, mechatronic systems in general and robotics in particular with
integrated Artificial Intelligence, to interact with dynamic and unstructured
environments. While the results are impressive, the application of such systems
to critical tasks like autonomous driving as well as service and care robotics
necessitate the evaluation of large amount of heterogeneous data. Automated
report generation for Mobile Robotics can play a crucial role in facilitating
the evaluation and acceptance of such systems in various domains. In this
paper, we propose a pipeline for generating automated reports in natural
language utilizing various multi-modal sensors that solely relies on local
models capable of being deployed on edge computing devices, thus preserving the
privacy of all actors involved and eliminating the need for external services.
In particular, we evaluate our implementation on a diverse dataset spanning
multiple domains including indoor, outdoor and urban environments, providing
quantitative as well as qualitative evaluation results. Various generated
example reports and other supplementary materials are available via a public

Abstract: Sparse-voxel rasterization is a fast, differentiable alternative for
optimization-based scene reconstruction, but it tends to underfit low-frequency
content, depends on brittle pruning heuristics, and can overgrow in ways that
inflate VRAM. We introduce LiteVoxel, a self-tuning training pipeline that
makes SV rasterization both steadier and lighter. Our loss is made
low-frequency aware via an inverse-Sobel reweighting with a mid-training
gamma-ramp, shifting gradient budget to flat regions only after geometry
stabilize. Adaptation replaces fixed thresholds with a depth-quantile pruning
logic on maximum blending weight, stabilized by EMA-hysteresis guards and
refines structure through ray-footprint-based, priority-driven subdivision
under an explicit growth budget. Ablations and full-system results across
Mip-NeRF 360 (6scenes) and Tanks & Temples (3scenes) datasets show mitigation
of errors in low-frequency regions and boundary instability while keeping
PSNR/SSIM, training time, and FPS comparable to a strong SVRaster pipeline.
Crucially, LiteVoxel reduces peak VRAM by ~40%-60% and preserves low-frequency
detail that prior setups miss, enabling more predictable, memory-efficient
training without sacrificing perceptual quality.

Abstract: Shearography is a non-destructive testing method for detecting subsurface
defects, offering high sensitivity and full-field inspection capabilities.
However, its industrial adoption remains limited due to the need for expert
interpretation. To reduce reliance on labeled data and manual evaluation, this
study explores unsupervised learning methods for automated anomaly detection in
shearographic images. Three architectures are evaluated: a fully connected
autoencoder, a convolutional autoencoder, and a student-teacher feature
matching model. All models are trained solely on defect-free data. A controlled
dataset was developed using a custom specimen with reproducible defect
patterns, enabling systematic acquisition of shearographic measurements under
both ideal and realistic deformation conditions. Two training subsets were
defined: one containing only undistorted, defect-free samples, and one
additionally including globally deformed, yet defect-free, data. The latter
simulates practical inspection conditions by incorporating deformation-induced
fringe patterns that may obscure localized anomalies. The models are evaluated
in terms of binary classification and, for the student-teacher model, spatial
defect localization. Results show that the student-teacher approach achieves
superior classification robustness and enables precise localization. Compared
to the autoencoder-based models, it demonstrates improved separability of
feature representations, as visualized through t-SNE embeddings. Additionally,
a YOLOv8 model trained on labeled defect data serves as a reference to
benchmark localization quality. This study underscores the potential of
unsupervised deep learning for scalable, label-efficient shearographic
inspection in industrial environments.

Abstract: Predicting future brain state from a baseline magnetic resonance image (MRI)
is a central challenge in neuroimaging and has important implications for
studying neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease (AD). Most
existing approaches predict future cognitive scores or clinical outcomes, such
as conversion from mild cognitive impairment to dementia. Instead, here we
investigate longitudinal MRI image-to-image prediction that forecasts a
participant's entire brain MRI several years into the future, intrinsically
modeling complex, spatially distributed neurodegenerative patterns. We
implement and evaluate five deep learning architectures (UNet, U2-Net, UNETR,
Time-Embedding UNet, and ODE-UNet) on two longitudinal cohorts (ADNI and AIBL).
Predicted follow-up MRIs are directly compared with the actual follow-up scans
using metrics that capture global similarity and local differences. The best
performing models achieve high-fidelity predictions, and all models generalize
well to an independent external dataset, demonstrating robust cross-cohort
performance. Our results indicate that deep learning can reliably predict
participant-specific brain MRI at the voxel level, offering new opportunities
for individualized prognosis.

Abstract: This report describes the UVH-26 dataset, the first public release by
AIM@IISc of a large-scale dataset of annotated traffic-camera images from
India. The dataset comprises 26,646 high-resolution (1080p) images sampled from
2800 Bengaluru's Safe-City CCTV cameras over a 4-week period, and subsequently
annotated through a crowdsourced hackathon involving 565 college students from
across India. In total, 1.8 million bounding boxes were labeled across 14
vehicle classes specific to India: Cycle, 2-Wheeler (Motorcycle), 3-Wheeler
(Auto-rickshaw), LCV (Light Commercial Vehicles), Van, Tempo-traveller,
Hatchback, Sedan, SUV, MUV, Mini-bus, Bus, Truck and Other. Of these, 283k-316k
consensus ground truth bounding boxes and labels were derived for distinct
objects in the 26k images using Majority Voting and STAPLE algorithms. Further,
we train multiple contemporary detectors, including YOLO11-S/X, RT-DETR-S/X,
and DAMO-YOLO-T/L using these datasets, and report accuracy based on mAP50,
mAP75 and mAP50:95. Models trained on UVH-26 achieve 8.4-31.5% improvements in
mAP50:95 over equivalent baseline models trained on COCO dataset, with
RT-DETR-X showing the best performance at 0.67 (mAP50:95) as compared to 0.40
for COCO-trained weights for common classes (Car, Bus, and Truck). This
demonstrates the benefits of domain-specific training data for Indian traffic
scenarios. The release package provides the 26k images with consensus
annotations based on Majority Voting (UVH-26-MV) and STAPLE (UVH-26-ST) and the
6 fine-tuned YOLO and DETR models on each of these datasets. By capturing the
heterogeneity of Indian urban mobility directly from operational traffic-camera
streams, UVH-26 addresses a critical gap in existing global benchmarks, and
offers a foundation for advancing detection, classification, and deployment of
intelligent transportation systems in emerging nations with complex traffic
conditions.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Video-based person re-identification (ReID) in cross-view domains (for
example, aerial-ground surveillance) remains an open problem because of extreme
viewpoint shifts, scale disparities, and temporal inconsistencies. To address
these challenges, we propose MTF-CVReID, a parameter-efficient framework that
introduces seven complementary modules over a ViT-B/16 backbone. Specifically,
we include: (1) Cross-Stream Feature Normalization (CSFN) to correct camera and
view biases; (2) Multi-Resolution Feature Harmonization (MRFH) for scale
stabilization across altitudes; (3) Identity-Aware Memory Module (IAMM) to
reinforce persistent identity traits; (4) Temporal Dynamics Modeling (TDM) for
motion-aware short-term temporal encoding; (5) Inter-View Feature Alignment
(IVFA) for perspective-invariant representation alignment; (6) Hierarchical
Temporal Pattern Learning (HTPL) to capture multi-scale temporal regularities;
and (7) Multi-View Identity Consistency Learning (MVICL) that enforces
cross-view identity coherence using a contrastive learning paradigm. Despite
adding only about 2 million parameters and 0.7 GFLOPs over the baseline,
MTF-CVReID maintains real-time efficiency (189 FPS) and achieves
state-of-the-art performance on the AG-VPReID benchmark across all altitude
levels, with strong cross-dataset generalization to G2A-VReID and MARS
datasets. These results show that carefully designed adapter-based modules can
substantially enhance cross-view robustness and temporal consistency without
compromising computational efficiency. The source code is available at

Abstract: Subject-agnostic brain decoding, which aims to reconstruct continuous visual
experiences from fMRI without subject-specific training, holds great potential
for clinical applications. However, this direction remains underexplored due to
challenges in cross-subject generalization and the complex nature of brain
signals. In this work, we propose Visual Cortex Flow Architecture (VCFlow), a
novel hierarchical decoding framework that explicitly models the ventral-dorsal
architecture of the human visual system to learn multi-dimensional
representations. By disentangling and leveraging features from early visual
cortex, ventral, and dorsal streams, VCFlow captures diverse and complementary
cognitive information essential for visual reconstruction. Furthermore, we
introduce a feature-level contrastive learning strategy to enhance the
extraction of subject-invariant semantic representations, thereby enhancing
subject-agnostic applicability to previously unseen subjects. Unlike
conventional pipelines that need more than 12 hours of per-subject data and
heavy computation, VCFlow sacrifices only 7\% accuracy on average yet generates
each reconstructed video in 10 seconds without any retraining, offering a fast
and clinically scalable solution. The source code will be released upon
acceptance of the paper.

Abstract: Despite the remarkable success of text-to-image diffusion models, their
output of a single, flattened image remains a critical bottleneck for
professional applications requiring layer-wise control. Existing solutions
either rely on fine-tuning with large, inaccessible datasets or are
training-free yet limited to generating isolated foreground elements, failing
to produce a complete and coherent scene. To address this, we introduce the
Training-free Noise Transplantation and Cultivation Diffusion Model (TAUE), a
novel framework for zero-shot, layer-wise image generation. Our core technique,
Noise Transplantation and Cultivation (NTC), extracts intermediate latent
representations from both foreground and composite generation processes,
transplanting them into the initial noise for subsequent layers. This ensures
semantic and structural coherence across foreground, background, and composite
layers, enabling consistent, multi-layered outputs without requiring
fine-tuning or auxiliary datasets. Extensive experiments show that our
training-free method achieves performance comparable to fine-tuned methods,
enhancing layer-wise consistency while maintaining high image quality and
fidelity. TAUE not only eliminates costly training and dataset requirements but
also unlocks novel downstream applications, such as complex compositional
editing, paving the way for more accessible and controllable generative
workflows.

Abstract: Multi-animal tracking is crucial for understanding animal ecology and

require extensive model fine-tuning and heuristic design for each application
scenario. In this work, we explore the potential of recent vision foundation
models for zero-shot multi-animal tracking. By combining a Grounding Dino
object detector with the Segment Anything Model 2 (SAM 2) tracker and carefully
designed heuristics, we develop a tracking framework that can be applied to new
datasets without any retraining or hyperparameter adaptation. Evaluations on
ChimpAct, Bird Flock Tracking, AnimalTrack, and a subset of GMOT-40 demonstrate
strong and consistent performance across diverse species and environments. The

Abstract: Change detection (CD) is a fundamental task for monitoring and analyzing land
cover dynamics. While recent high performance models and high quality datasets
have significantly advanced the field, a critical limitation persists. Current
models typically acquire limited knowledge from single-type annotated data and
cannot concurrently leverage diverse binary change detection (BCD) and semantic
change detection (SCD) datasets. This constraint leads to poor generalization
and limited versatility. The recent advancements in Multimodal Large Language
Models (MLLMs) introduce new possibilities for a unified CD framework. We
leverage the language priors and unification capabilities of MLLMs to develop
UniChange, the first MLLM-based unified change detection model. UniChange
integrates generative language abilities with specialized CD functionalities.
Our model successfully unifies both BCD and SCD tasks through the introduction
of three special tokens: [T1], [T2], and [CHANGE]. Furthermore, UniChange
utilizes text prompts to guide the identification of change categories,
eliminating the reliance on predefined classification heads. This design allows
UniChange to effectively acquire knowledge from multi-source datasets, even
when their class definitions conflict. Experiments on four public benchmarks
(WHU-CD, S2Looking, LEVIR-CD+, and SECOND) demonstrate SOTA performance,
achieving IoU scores of 90.41, 53.04, 78.87, and 57.62, respectively,
surpassing all previous methods. The code is available at

Abstract: Biometric technologies are widely adopted in security, legal, and financial
systems. Face recognition can authenticate a person based on the unique facial
features such as shape and texture. However, recent works have demonstrated the
vulnerability of Face Recognition Systems (FRS) towards presentation attacks.
Using spoofing (aka.,presentation attacks), a malicious actor can get
illegitimate access to secure systems. This paper proposes a novel light-weight
CNN framework to identify print/display, video and wrap attacks. The proposed
robust architecture provides seamless liveness detection ensuring faster
biometric authentication (1-2 seconds on CPU). Further, this also presents a
newly created 2D spoof attack dataset consisting of more than 500 videos
collected from 60 subjects. To validate the effectiveness of this architecture,
we provide a demonstration video depicting print/display, video and wrap attack

Abstract: Large multimodal models (LMMs) often suffer from severe inference
inefficiency due to the large number of visual tokens introduced by image
encoders. While recent token compression methods, such as pruning and merging,
have shown promise in reducing redundancy, their evaluation remains fragmented
and inconsistent. In this work, we present UniPruneBench, a unified and
extensible benchmark for visual token pruning in multimodal LLMs. UniPruneBench
provides standardized protocols across six ability dimensions and ten datasets,
covering ten representative compression algorithms and three families of LMMs
(LLaVA-v1.5, Intern-VL3, and Qwen2.5-VL). Beyond task accuracy, it incorporates
system-level metrics such as runtime and prefilling latency to provide a
holistic view. Our experiments uncover several key findings: (1) random pruning
is a surprisingly strong baseline, (2) no single method consistently
outperforms others across scenarios, (3) pruning sensitivity varies
significantly across tasks, with OCR being most vulnerable, and (4) pruning
ratio is the dominant factor governing performance degradation. We believe
UniPruneBench will serve as a reliable foundation for future research on
efficient multimodal modeling.

Abstract: Visible-infrared person re-identification (VI-ReID) technique could associate
the pedestrian images across visible and infrared modalities in the practical
scenarios of background illumination changes. However, a substantial gap
inherently exists between these two modalities. Besides, existing methods
primarily rely on intermediate representations to align cross-modal features of
the same person. The intermediate feature representations are usually create by
generating intermediate images (kind of data enhancement), or fusing
intermediate features (more parameters, lack of interpretability), and they do
not make good use of the intermediate features. Thus, we propose a novel
VI-ReID framework via Modality-Transition Representation Learning (MTRL) with a
middle generated image as a transmitter from visible to infrared modals, which
are fully aligned with the original visible images and similar to the infrared
modality. After that, using a modality-transition contrastive loss and a
modality-query regularization loss for training, which could align the
cross-modal features more effectively. Notably, our proposed framework does not
need any additional parameters, which achieves the same inference speed to the
backbone while improving its performance on VI-ReID task. Extensive
experimental results illustrate that our model significantly and consistently
outperforms existing SOTAs on three typical VI-ReID datasets.

Abstract: Understanding and predicting emotion from videos has gathered significant
attention in recent studies, driven by advancements in video large language
models (VideoLLMs). While advanced methods have made progress in video emotion
analysis, the intrinsic nature of emotions poses significant challenges.
Emotions are characterized by dynamic and cues-dependent properties, making it
difficult to understand complex and evolving emotional states with reasonable
rationale. To tackle these challenges, we propose a novel affective cues-guided
reasoning framework that unifies fundamental attribute perception, expression
analysis, and high-level emotional understanding in a stage-wise manner. At the
core of our approach is a family of video emotion foundation models (VidEmo),
specifically designed for emotion reasoning and instruction-following. These
models undergo a two-stage tuning process: first, curriculum emotion learning
for injecting emotion knowledge, followed by affective-tree reinforcement
learning for emotion reasoning. Moreover, we establish a foundational data
infrastructure and introduce a emotion-centric fine-grained dataset (Emo-CFG)
consisting of 2.1M diverse instruction-based samples. Emo-CFG includes
explainable emotional question-answering, fine-grained captions, and associated
rationales, providing essential resources for advancing emotion understanding
tasks. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach achieves competitive
performance, setting a new milestone across 15 face perception tasks.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) underpin many modern computer vision
systems. With applications ranging from common to critical areas, a need to
explain and understand the model and its decisions (XAI) emerged. Prior works
suggest that in the top layers of CNNs, the individual channels can be
attributed to classifying human-understandable concepts. Concept relevance
propagation (CRP) methods can backtrack predictions to these channels and find
images that most activate these channels. However, current CRP workflows are
largely manual: experts must inspect activation images to name the discovered
concepts and must synthesize verbose explanations from relevance maps, limiting
the accessibility of the explanations and their scalability.
  To address these issues, we introduce Large Language model EXplaIns COncept
Relevance Propagation (LLEXICORP), a modular pipeline that couples CRP with a
multimodal large language model. Our approach automatically assigns descriptive
names to concept prototypes and generates natural-language explanations that
translate quantitative relevance distributions into intuitive narratives. To
ensure faithfulness, we craft prompts that teach the language model the
semantics of CRP through examples and enforce a separation between naming and
explanation tasks. The resulting text can be tailored to different audiences,
offering low-level technical descriptions for experts and high-level summaries
for non-technical stakeholders.
  We qualitatively evaluate our method on various images from ImageNet on a
VGG16 model. Our findings suggest that integrating concept-based attribution
methods with large language models can significantly lower the barrier to
interpreting deep neural networks, paving the way for more transparent AI
systems.

Abstract: The alignment of representations from different modalities has recently been
shown to provide insights on the structural similarities and downstream
capabilities of different encoders across diverse data types. While significant
progress has been made in aligning images with text, the temporal nature of
video data remains largely unexplored in this context. In this work, we conduct
the first comprehensive study of video-text representation alignment, probing
the capabilities of modern video and language encoders. Our findings reveal
several key insights. First, we demonstrate that cross-modal alignment highly
depends on the richness of both visual (static images vs. multi-frame videos)
and text (single caption vs. a collection) data provided at test time,
especially when using state-of-the-art video encoders. We propose parametric
test-time scaling laws that capture this behavior and show remarkable
predictive power against empirical observations. Secondly, we investigate the
correlation between semantic alignment and performance on both semantic and
non-semantic downstream tasks, providing initial evidence that strong alignment
against text encoders may be linked to general-purpose video representation and
understanding. Finally, we correlate temporal reasoning with cross-modal
alignment providing a challenging test-bed for vision and language models.
Overall, our work introduces video-text alignment as an informative zero-shot
way to probe the representation power of different encoders for spatio-temporal
data. Project page can be found at https://video-prh.github.io/

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: We present PercHead, a method for single-image 3D head reconstruction and
semantic 3D editing - two tasks that are inherently challenging due to severe
view occlusions, weak perceptual supervision, and the ambiguity of editing in
3D space. We develop a unified base model for reconstructing view-consistent 3D
heads from a single input image. The model employs a dual-branch encoder
followed by a ViT-based decoder that lifts 2D features into 3D space through
iterative cross-attention. Rendering is performed using Gaussian Splatting. At
the heart of our approach is a novel perceptual supervision strategy based on
DINOv2 and SAM2.1, which provides rich, generalized signals for both geometric
and appearance fidelity. Our model achieves state-of-the-art performance in
novel-view synthesis and, furthermore, exhibits exceptional robustness to
extreme viewing angles compared to established baselines. Furthermore, this
base model can be seamlessly extended for semantic 3D editing by swapping the
encoder and finetuning the network. In this variant, we disentangle geometry
and style through two distinct input modalities: a segmentation map to control
geometry and either a text prompt or a reference image to specify appearance.
We highlight the intuitive and powerful 3D editing capabilities of our model
through a lightweight, interactive GUI, where users can effortlessly sculpt
geometry by drawing segmentation maps and stylize appearance via natural
language or image prompts.

Abstract: Code has emerged as a precise and executable medium for reasoning and action
in the agent era. Yet, progress has largely focused on language-centric tasks
such as program synthesis and debugging, leaving visual-centric coding
underexplored. Inspired by how humans reason over sketches, we advocate SVG
code as a compact, interpretable, and executable visual representation. We
introduce VCode, a benchmark that reframes multimodal understanding as code
generation: given an image, a model must produce SVG that preserves symbolic
meaning for downstream reasoning. VCode covers three domains - general
commonsense (MM-Vet), professional disciplines (MMMU), and visual-centric
perception (CV-Bench). To assess symbolic fidelity, we propose CodeVQA, a novel
evaluation protocol in which a policy model answers questions over rendered
SVGs; correct answers indicate faithful symbolic preservation. Empirically,
frontier VLMs struggle to generate faithful SVGs, revealing a persistent gap
between language-centric and visual-centric coding. To close this gap, we
introduce VCoder, an agentic framework that augments VLMs along two axes: (i)
Thinking with Revision, which iteratively analyzes discrepancies and refines
SVG code; and (ii) Acting with Visual Tools, where detectors and parsers supply
structured cues such as objects, shapes, and text beyond the model's intrinsic
capacity. Across benchmarks, frontier VLMs with strong reasoning capabilities
score well overall yet remain limited in professional knowledge and 3D
reasoning. VCoder delivers a 12.3-point overall gain over the top-performing
Claude-4-Opus. Human studies show that both humans and VLMs perform worse on
rendered SVGs, their consistency reveals the promise of symbolic visual
representation. The benchmark and code are available at

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: We propose MIRA, a new benchmark designed to evaluate models in scenarios
where generating intermediate visual images is essential for successful
reasoning. Unlike traditional CoT methods that rely solely on text, tasks in
MIRA require models to generate and utilize intermediate images - such as
sketches, structural diagrams, or path drawings - to guide their reasoning
process. This setup closely mirrors how humans solve complex problems through
"drawing to think". To solve this, MIRA focuses on tasks that are intrinsically
challenging and involve complex structures, spatial relationships, or reasoning
steps that are difficult to express through language alone. To ensure that our
evaluation data is of high-quality, we include 546 multimodal problems,
annotated with intermediate visual images and final answers. We also propose a
unified evaluation protocol for MIRA that spans three levels of evaluation
input: direct input with image and question only, text-only CoT input with
image and thinking prompts, and Visual-CoT input with both annotated image
clues and textual thinking prompts. To probe the upper bound of model capacity
on our benchmark, we also report pass@k and majority voting accuracies under
different k settings. Experimental results show that existing multimodal large
language models, including strongest private models as well as strong
open-weight models, perform poorly when relying solely on textual prompts.
However, when intermediate visual cues are provided, model performance improves
consistently, yielding an average relative gain of 33.7% across all models and
tasks. We also probe the upper bound by expanding the search space and
designing textual prompts aligned with Visual-CoT, but both yield only limited
improvements compared to our Visual-CoT setting. These results underscore the
critical role of imagined visual information in enabling successful reasoning
on MIRA.

Abstract: The threats posed by AI-generated media, particularly deepfakes, are now
raising significant challenges for multimedia forensics, misinformation
detection, and biometric system resulting in erosion of public trust in the
legal system, significant increase in frauds, and social engineering attacks.
Although several forensic methods have been proposed, they suffer from three
critical gaps: (i) use of non-standardized benchmarks with GAN- or
diffusion-generated images, (ii) inconsistent training protocols (e.g.,
scratch, frozen, fine-tuning), and (iii) limited evaluation metrics that fail
to capture generalization and explainability. These limitations hinder fair
comparison, obscure true robustness, and restrict deployment in
security-critical applications. This paper introduces a unified benchmarking
framework for systematic evaluation of forensic methods under controlled and
reproducible conditions. We benchmark ten SoTA forensic methods (scratch,
frozen, and fine-tuned) and seven publicly available datasets (GAN and
diffusion) to perform extensive and systematic evaluations. We evaluate
performance using multiple metrics, including accuracy, average precision,
ROC-AUC, error rate, and class-wise sensitivity. We also further analyze model
interpretability using confidence curves and Grad-CAM heatmaps. Our evaluations
demonstrate substantial variability in generalization, with certain methods
exhibiting strong in-distribution performance but degraded cross-model
transferability. This study aims to guide the research community toward a
deeper understanding of the strengths and limitations of current forensic
approaches, and to inspire the development of more robust, generalizable, and
explainable solutions.

Abstract: Foundation models trained on large-scale pathology image corpora have
demonstrated strong transfer capabilities across diverse histopathology tasks.
Building on this progress, we introduce PLUTO-4, our next generation of
pathology foundation models that extend the Pathology-Universal Transformer
(PLUTO) to frontier scale. We share two complementary Vision Transformer
architectures in the PLUTO-4 family: a compact and efficient PLUTO-4S model
optimized for multi-scale deployment using a FlexiViT setup with 2D-RoPE
embeddings, and a frontier-scale PLUTO-4G model trained with a single patch
size to maximize representation capacity and stability. Both models are
pretrained using a self-supervised objective derived from DINOv2 on a large
multi-institutional corpus containing 551,164 WSIs from 137,144 patients across
over 50 institutions, spanning over 60 disease types and over 100 stains.
Comprehensive evaluation across public and internal benchmarks demonstrates
that PLUTO-4 achieves state-of-the-art performance on tasks requiring varying
spatial and biological context, including patch-level classification,
segmentation, and slide-level diagnosis. The compact PLUTO-4S provides
high-throughput and robust performance for practical deployment, while PLUTO-4G
establishes new performance frontiers across multiple pathology benchmarks,
including an 11% improvement in dermatopathology diagnosis. These diverse
improvements underscore PLUTO-4's potential to transform real-world
applications as a backbone for translational research and diagnostic use cases.

Abstract: We propose DenseMarks - a new learned representation for human heads,
enabling high-quality dense correspondences of human head images. For a 2D
image of a human head, a Vision Transformer network predicts a 3D embedding for
each pixel, which corresponds to a location in a 3D canonical unit cube. In
order to train our network, we collect a dataset of pairwise point matches,
estimated by a state-of-the-art point tracker over a collection of diverse
in-the-wild talking heads videos, and guide the mapping via a contrastive loss,
encouraging matched points to have close embeddings. We further employ
multi-task learning with face landmarks and segmentation constraints, as well
as imposing spatial continuity of embeddings through latent cube features,
which results in an interpretable and queryable canonical space. The
representation can be used for finding common semantic parts, face/head
tracking, and stereo reconstruction. Due to the strong supervision, our method
is robust to pose variations and covers the entire head, including hair.
Additionally, the canonical space bottleneck makes sure the obtained
representations are consistent across diverse poses and individuals. We
demonstrate state-of-the-art results in geometry-aware point matching and
monocular head tracking with 3D Morphable Models. The code and the model
checkpoint will be made available to the public.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Developing efficient CUDA kernels is increasingly critical for AI
applications such as large-scale LLM training. However, manual kernel design is
both costly and time-consuming, motivating automatic approaches that leverage
LLMs for code generation. Existing methods for automatic kernel generation,
however, often produce low-efficiency kernels, incur high computational
overhead, and fail to generalize across settings. In this work, we propose
CudaForge, a training-free multi-agent workflow for CUDA kernel generation and
optimization. Our workflow is inspired by the iterative workflow of human
experts, which contains steps such as developing initial kernels, testing
correctness, analyzing hardware feedback, and iterative improvement. More
specifically, CudaForge employs two LLM agents: a Coder and a Judge, that
iteratively generate, correct, and optimize CUDA kernels, while integrating
hardware feedback such as Nsight Compute (NCU) metrics. In extensive
evaluations, we show that CudaForge, by leveraging base models like OpenAI-o3,
achieves 97.6\% correctness of generated kernels and an average 1.68$\times$
speedup over PyTorch baselines, substantially surpassing state-of-the-art
models including OpenAI-o3 and Kevin on KernelBench. Beyond accuracy and speed,
CudaForge demonstrates strong generalization across GPUs (A100, RTX 6000, 4090,
3090) and base models (OpenAI-o3, GPT-5, gpt-oss-120B, Claude-Sonnet-4,
QwQ-32B), while maintaining high efficiency. In particular, generating an
optimized kernel takes about 26.5 minutes on one RTX6000 and incurs about \$
0.3 API cost, which is significantly cheaper than existing agentic work that
costs 6 H100 hours and \$ 5 API cost per kernel. Our results highlight that
multi-agent, training-free workflows can enable cost-effective, generalizable,
and high-performance CUDA kernel optimization. Code available at

Abstract: Multimodal deep learning has shown promise in depression detection by

computational cost, domain mismatch, and static knowledge limitations. To
address these issues, we propose a novel Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)
framework. Given a depression-related text, our method retrieves semantically
relevant emotional content from a sentiment dataset and uses a Large Language

enriches emotional representation and improves interpretability. Experiments on
the AVEC 2019 dataset show our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance
with CCC of 0.593 and MAE of 3.95, surpassing previous transfer learning and
multi-task learning baselines.

Abstract: Classification is a machine learning method used in many practical
applications: text mining, handwritten character recognition, face recognition,
pattern classification, scene labeling, computer vision, natural langage
processing. A classifier prediction results and training set information are
often used to get a contingency table which is used to quantify the method
quality through an evaluation measure. Such measure, typically a numerical
value, allows to choose a suitable method among several. Many evaluation
measures available in the literature are less accurate for a dataset with
imbalanced classes. In this paper, the eigenvalues entropy is used as an
evaluation measure for a binary or a multi-class problem. For a binary problem,
relations are given between the eigenvalues and some commonly used measures,
the sensitivity, the specificity, the area under the operating receiver
characteristic curve and the Gini index. A by-product result of this paper is
an estimate of the confusion matrix to deal with the curse of the imbalanced
classes. Various data examples are used to show the better performance of the
proposed evaluation measure over the gold standard measures available in the
literature.

(SGD), a novel optimizer linking gradient updates with quantum superposition by
injecting quantum circuit perturbations. We present a mathematical framework
and implement hybrid quantum-classical circuits in PyTorch and Qiskit. On
synthetic sequence classification and large-scale LLM fine-tuning, SGD
converges faster and yields lower final loss than AdamW. Despite promising
results, scalability and hardware constraints limit adoption. Overall, this

Abstract: We introduce Neural Green's Function, a neural solution operator for linear
partial differential equations (PDEs) whose differential operators admit
eigendecompositions. Inspired by Green's functions, the solution operators of
linear PDEs that depend exclusively on the domain geometry, we design Neural
Green's Function to imitate their behavior, achieving superior generalization
across diverse irregular geometries and source and boundary functions.
Specifically, Neural Green's Function extracts per-point features from a
volumetric point cloud representing the problem domain and uses them to predict
a decomposition of the solution operator, which is subsequently applied to
evaluate solutions via numerical integration. Unlike recent learning-based
solution operators, which often struggle to generalize to unseen source or
boundary functions, our framework is, by design, agnostic to the specific
functions used during training, enabling robust and efficient generalization.
In the steady-state thermal analysis of mechanical part geometries from the MCB
dataset, Neural Green's Function outperforms state-of-the-art neural operators,
achieving an average error reduction of 13.9\% across five shape categories,
while being up to 350 times faster than a numerical solver that requires
computationally expensive meshing.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Solving large-scale Generalized Eigenvalue Problems (GEPs) is a fundamental
yet computationally prohibitive task in science and engineering. As a promising
direction, contour integral (CI) methods, such as the CIRR algorithm, offer an
efficient and parallelizable framework. However, their performance is
critically dependent on the selection of integration contours -- improper
selection without reliable prior knowledge of eigenvalue distribution can incur
significant computational overhead and compromise numerical accuracy. To
address this challenge, we propose DeepContour, a novel hybrid framework that
integrates a deep learning-based spectral predictor with Kernel Density
Estimation for principled contour design. Specifically, DeepContour first
employs a Fourier Neural Operator (FNO) to rapidly predict the spectral
distribution of a given GEP. Subsequently, Kernel Density Estimation (KDE) is
applied to the predicted spectrum to automatically and systematically determine
proper integration contours. Finally, these optimized contours guide the CI
solver to efficiently find the desired eigenvalues. We demonstrate the
effectiveness of our method on diverse challenging scientific problems. In our
main experiments, DeepContour accelerates GEP solving across multiple datasets,
achieving up to a 5.63$\times$ speedup. By combining the predictive power of
deep learning with the numerical rigor of classical solvers, this work pioneers
an efficient and robust paradigm for tackling difficult generalized eigenvalue
involving matrices of high dimension.

Abstract: Human trajectory data is crucial in urban planning, traffic engineering, and
public health. However, directly using real-world trajectory data often faces
challenges such as privacy concerns, data acquisition costs, and data quality.
A practical solution to these challenges is trajectory generation, a method
developed to simulate human mobility behaviors. Existing trajectory generation
methods mainly focus on capturing individual movement patterns but often
overlook the influence of population distribution on trajectory generation. In
reality, dynamic population distribution reflects changes in population density
across different regions, significantly impacting individual mobility behavior.
Thus, we propose a novel trajectory generation framework based on a diffusion
model, which integrates the dynamic population distribution constraints to
guide high-fidelity generation outcomes. Specifically, we construct a spatial
graph to enhance the spatial correlation of trajectories. Then, we design a
dynamic population distribution aware denoising network to capture the
spatiotemporal dependencies of human mobility behavior as well as the impact of
population distribution in the denoising process. Extensive experiments show
that the trajectories generated by our model can resemble real-world
trajectories in terms of some critical statistical metrics, outperforming
state-of-the-art algorithms by over 54%.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Image generation models are usually personalized in practical uses in order
to better meet the individual users' heterogeneous needs, but most personalized
models lack explainability about how they are being personalized. Such
explainability can be provided via visual features in generated images, but is
difficult for human users to understand. Explainability in natural language is
a better choice, but the existing approaches to explainability in natural
language are limited to be coarse-grained. They are unable to precisely
identify the multiple aspects of personalization, as well as the varying levels
of personalization in each aspect. To address such limitation, in this paper we
present a new technique, namely \textbf{FineXL}, towards \textbf{Fine}-grained
e\textbf{X}plainability in natural \textbf{L}anguage for personalized image
generation models. FineXL can provide natural language descriptions about each
distinct aspect of personalization, along with quantitative scores indicating
the level of each aspect of personalization. Experiment results show that
FineXL can improve the accuracy of explainability by 56\%, when different
personalization scenarios are applied to multiple types of image generation
models.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Training tool-augmented LLMs has emerged as a promising approach to enhancing
language models' capabilities for complex tasks. The current supervised
fine-tuning paradigm relies on constructing extensive domain-specific datasets
to train models. However, this approach often struggles to generalize
effectively to unfamiliar or intricate tool-use scenarios. Recently,
reinforcement learning (RL) paradigm can endow LLMs with superior reasoning and
generalization abilities. In this work, we address a key question: Can the pure
RL be used to effectively elicit a model's intrinsic reasoning capabilities and
enhance the tool-agnostic generalization? We propose a dynamic
generalization-guided reward design for rule-based RL, which progressively
shifts rewards from exploratory to exploitative tool-use patterns. Based on
this design, we introduce the Tool-Zero series models. These models are trained
to enable LLMs to autonomously utilize general tools by directly scaling up RL
from Zero models (i.e., base models without post-training). Experimental
results demonstrate that our models achieve over 7% performance improvement
compared to both SFT and RL-with-SFT models under the same experimental
settings. These gains are consistently replicated across cross-dataset and
intra-dataset evaluations, validating the effectiveness and robustness of our
methods.

Abstract: The determination of sample size in qualitative research has traditionally
relied on the subjective and often ambiguous principle of data saturation,
which can lead to inconsistencies and threaten methodological rigor. This study
introduces a new, systematic model based on machine learning (ML) to make this
process more objective. Utilizing a dataset derived from five fundamental
qualitative research approaches - namely, Case Study, Grounded Theory,
Phenomenology, Narrative Research, and Ethnographic Research - we developed an
ensemble learning model. Ten critical parameters, including research scope,
information power, and researcher competence, were evaluated using an ordinal
scale and used as input features. After thorough preprocessing and outlier
removal, multiple ML algorithms were trained and compared. The K-Nearest
Neighbors (KNN), Gradient Boosting (GB), Random Forest (RF), XGBoost, and
Decision Tree (DT) algorithms showed the highest explanatory power (Test R2 ~
0.85), effectively modeling the complex, non-linear relationships involved in
qualitative sampling decisions. Feature importance analysis confirmed the vital
roles of research design type and information power, providing quantitative
validation of key theoretical assumptions in qualitative methodology. The study
concludes by proposing a conceptual framework for a web-based computational
application designed to serve as a decision support system for qualitative
researchers, journal reviewers, and thesis advisors. This model represents a
significant step toward standardizing sample size justification, enhancing
transparency, and strengthening the epistemological foundation of qualitative

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) trained for step-by-step reasoning often become
excessively verbose, raising inference cost. Standard Reinforcement Learning
with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) pipelines filter out ``easy'' problems for
training efficiency, leaving the model to train primarily on harder problems
that require longer reasoning chains. This skews the output length distribution
upward, resulting in a \textbf{model that conflates ``thinking longer'' with
``thinking better''}. In this work, we show that retaining and modestly
up-weighting moderately easy problems acts as an implicit length regularizer.
Exposing the model to solvable short-chain tasks constrains its output
distribution and prevents runaway verbosity. The result is
\textbf{\emph{emergent brevity for free}}: the model learns to solve harder
problems without inflating the output length, \textbf{ despite the absence of
any explicit length penalization}. RLVR experiments using this approach on
\textit{Qwen3-4B-Thinking-2507} (with a 16k token limit) achieve baseline
pass@1 AIME25 accuracy while generating solutions that are, on average, nearly
twice as short. The code is available at

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Grokking is a puzzling phenomenon in neural networks where full
generalization occurs only after a substantial delay following the complete
memorization of the training data. Previous research has linked this delayed
generalization to representation learning driven by weight decay, but the
precise underlying dynamics remain elusive. In this paper, we argue that
post-memorization learning can be understood through the lens of constrained
optimization: gradient descent effectively minimizes the weight norm on the
zero-loss manifold. We formally prove this in the limit of infinitesimally
small learning rates and weight decay coefficients. To further dissect this
regime, we introduce an approximation that decouples the learning dynamics of a
subset of parameters from the rest of the network. Applying this framework, we
derive a closed-form expression for the post-memorization dynamics of the first
layer in a two-layer network. Experiments confirm that simulating the training
process using our predicted gradients reproduces both the delayed
generalization and representation learning characteristic of grokking.

Abstract: Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a severe disease with a typical
survival of 3-5 years after symptom onset. Current treatments offer only
limited life extension, and the variability in patient responses highlights the
need for personalized care. However, research is hindered by small,
heterogeneous cohorts, sparse longitudinal data, and the lack of a clear
definition for clinically meaningful patient clusters. Existing clustering
methods remain limited in both scope and number. To address this, we propose a
clustering approach that groups sequences using a disease progression
declarative score. Our approach integrates medical expertise through multiple
descriptive variables, investigating several distance measures combining such
variables, both by reusing off-the-shelf distances and employing a
weak-supervised learning method. We pair these distances with clustering
methods and benchmark them against state-of-the-art techniques. The evaluation
of our approach on a dataset of 353 ALS patients from the University Hospital
of Tours, shows that our method outperforms state-of-the-art methods in
survival analysis while achieving comparable silhouette scores. In addition,
the learned distances enhance the relevance and interpretability of results for
medical experts.

Abstract: Covalent organic frameworks (COFs) are promising adsorbents for gas
adsorption and separation, while identifying the optimal structures among their
vast design space requires efficient high-throughput screening. Conventional
machine-learning predictors rely heavily on specific gas-related features.
However, these features are time-consuming and limit scalability, leading to
inefficiency and labor-intensive processes. Herein, a universal COFs adsorption
prediction framework (COFAP) is proposed, which can extract multi-modal
structural and chemical features through deep learning, and fuse these
complementary features via cross-modal attention mechanism. Without Henry
coefficients or adsorption heat, COFAP sets a new SOTA by outperforming
previous approaches on hypoCOFs dataset. Based on COFAP, we also found that
high-performing COFs for separation concentrate within a narrow range of pore
size and surface area. A weight-adjustable prioritization scheme is also
developed to enable flexible, application-specific ranking of candidate COFs
for researchers. Superior efficiency and accuracy render COFAP directly
deployable in crystalline porous materials.

Abstract: Cardiovascular disease (CVD) remains a critical global health concern,
demanding reliable and interpretable predictive models for early risk
assessment. This study presents a large-scale analysis using the Heart Disease
Health Indicators Dataset, developing a strategically weighted ensemble model
that combines tree-based methods (LightGBM, XGBoost) with a Convolutional
Neural Network (CNN) to predict CVD risk. The model was trained on a
preprocessed dataset of 229,781 patients where the inherent class imbalance was
managed through strategic weighting and feature engineering enhanced the
original 22 features to 25. The final ensemble achieves a statistically
significant improvement over the best individual model, with a Test AUC of
0.8371 (p=0.003) and is particularly suited for screening with a high recall of
80.0%. To provide transparency and clinical interpretability, surrogate
decision trees and SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) are used. The proposed
model delivers a combination of robust predictive performance and clinical
transparency by blending diverse learning architectures and incorporating
explainability through SHAP and surrogate decision trees, making it a strong
candidate for real-world deployment in public health screening.

Abstract: Standard Recurrent Neural Networks, including LSTMs, struggle to model
long-range dependencies, particularly in sequences containing noisy or
misleading information. We propose a new architectural principle,
Output-Conditioned Gating, which enables a model to perform self-reflection by
modulating its internal memory gates based on its own past inferences. This
creates a stabilizing feedback loop that enhances memory retention. Our final
model, the EchoLSTM, integrates this principle with an attention mechanism. We
evaluate the EchoLSTM on a series of challenging benchmarks. On a
custom-designed Distractor Signal Task, the EchoLSTM achieves 69.0% accuracy,
decisively outperforming a standard LSTM baseline by 33 percentage points.
Furthermore, on the standard ListOps benchmark, the EchoLSTM achieves
performance competitive with a modern Transformer model, 69.8% vs. 71.8%, while
being over 5 times more parameter-efficient. A final Trigger Sensitivity Test
provides qualitative evidence that our model's self-reflective mechanism leads
to a fundamentally more robust memory system.

Abstract: Electroencephalography (EEG) and local field potentials (LFP) are two widely
used techniques to record electrical activity from the brain. These signals are
used in both the clinical and research domains for multiple applications.
However, most brain data recordings suffer from a myriad of artifacts and noise
sources other than the brain itself. Thus, a major requirement for their use is
proper and, given current volumes of data, a fully automatized conditioning. As
a means to this end, here we introduce an unsupervised, multipurpose EEG/LFP
preprocessing method, the NeuroClean pipeline. In addition to its completeness
and reliability, NeuroClean is an unsupervised series of algorithms intended to
mitigate reproducibility issues and biases caused by human intervention. The
pipeline is designed as a five-step process, including the common bandpass and
line noise filtering, and bad channel rejection. However, it incorporates an
efficient independent component analysis with an automatic component rejection
based on a clustering algorithm. This machine learning classifier is used to
ensure that task-relevant information is preserved after each step of the
cleaning process. We used several data sets to validate the pipeline.
NeuroClean removed several common types of artifacts from the signal. Moreover,
in the context of motor tasks of varying complexity, it yielded more than 97%
accuracy (vs. a chance-level of 33.3%) in an optimized Multinomial Logistic
Regression model after cleaning the data, compared to the raw data, which
performed at 74% accuracy. These results show that NeuroClean is a promising
pipeline and workflow that can be applied to future work and studies to achieve
better generalization and performance on machine learning pipelines.

Abstract: We present the bulk-boundary decomposition as a new framework for
understanding the training dynamics of deep neural networks. Starting from the
stochastic gradient descent formulation, we show that the Lagrangian can be
reorganized into a data-independent bulk term and a data-dependent boundary
term. The bulk captures the intrinsic dynamics set by network architecture and
activation functions, while the boundary reflects stochastic interactions from
training samples at the input and output layers. This decomposition exposes the
local and homogeneous structure underlying deep networks. As a natural
extension, we develop a field-theoretic formulation of neural dynamics based on
this decomposition.

Abstract: Speculative decoding accelerates LLMs by using a lightweight draft model to
generate tokens autoregressively before verifying them in parallel with a
larger target model. However, determining the optimal number of tokens to draft
remains a key challenge limiting the approach's effectiveness. Dynamic
speculative decoding aims to intelligently decide how many tokens to draft to
achieve maximum speedups. Existing methods often rely on hand-tuned, sensitive
thresholds (e.g., token entropy), which are costly to set and generalize poorly
across models and domains. We propose TapOut, an online, training-free,
plug-and-play algorithm for dynamic speculation policy selection using
multi-armed bandits. Our approach employs a meta-algorithm that selects among
multiple parameter-free dynamic speculation strategies based on past reward and
exploration. We conduct extensive experiments across diverse model pairs and
datasets, showing that TapOut achieves competitive or superior speedups
compared to well-established dynamic speculation baselines without any
hyperparameter tuning.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Recent work has discovered that large language models can develop broadly
misaligned behaviors after being fine-tuned on narrowly harmful datasets, a
phenomenon known as emergent misalignment (EM). However, the fundamental
mechanisms enabling such harmful generalization across disparate domains remain
poorly understood. In this work, we adopt a geometric perspective to study EM
and demonstrate that it exhibits a fundamental cross-task linear structure in
how harmful behavior is encoded across different datasets. Specifically, we
find a strong convergence in EM parameters across tasks, with the fine-tuned
weight updates showing relatively high cosine similarities, as well as shared
lower-dimensional subspaces as measured by their principal angles and
projection overlaps. Furthermore, we also show functional equivalence via
linear mode connectivity, wherein interpolated models across narrow
misalignment tasks maintain coherent, broadly misaligned behavior. Our results
indicate that EM arises from different narrow tasks discovering the same set of
shared parameter directions, suggesting that harmful behaviors may be organized
into specific, predictable regions of the weight landscape. By revealing this
fundamental connection between parametric geometry and behavioral outcomes, we
hope our work catalyzes further research on parameter space interpretability
and weight-based interventions.

Abstract: Catastrophic forgetting is one of the fundamental issues of continual
learning because neural networks forget the tasks learned previously when
trained on new tasks. The proposed framework is a new path-coordinated
framework of continual learning that unites the Neural Tangent Kernel (NTK)
theory of principled plasticity bounds, statistical validation by Wilson
confidence intervals, and evaluation of path quality by the use of multiple
metrics. Experimental evaluation shows an average accuracy of 66.7% at the cost
of 23.4% catastrophic forgetting on Split-CIFAR10, a huge improvement over the
baseline and competitive performance achieved, which is very close to
state-of-the-art results. Further, it is found out that NTK condition numbers
are predictive indicators of learning capacity limits, showing the existence of
a critical threshold at condition number $>10^{11}$. It is interesting to note
that the proposed strategy shows a tendency of lowering forgetting as the
sequence of tasks progresses (27% to 18%), which is a system stabilization. The
framework validates 80% of discovered paths with a rigorous statistical
guarantee and maintains 90-97% retention on intermediate tasks. The core
capacity limits of the continual learning environment are determined in the
analysis, and actionable insights to enhance the adaptive regularization are
offered.

Abstract: Predicting interspecies interactions is a key challenge in microbial ecology,
as these interactions are critical to determining the structure and activity of
microbial communities. In this work, we used data on monoculture growth
capabilities, interactions with other species, and phylogeny to predict a
negative or positive effect of interactions. More precisely, we used one of the
largest available pairwise interaction datasets to train our models, comprising
over 7,500 interactions be- tween 20 species from two taxonomic groups
co-cultured under 40 distinct carbon conditions, with a primary focus on the
work of Nestor et al.[28 ]. In this work, we propose Graph Neural Networks
(GNNs) as a powerful classifier to predict the direction of the effect. We
construct edge-graphs of pairwise microbial interactions in order to leverage
shared information across individual co-culture experiments, and use GNNs to
predict modes of interaction. Our model can not only predict binary
interactions (positive/negative) but also classify more complex interaction
types such as mutualism, competition, and parasitism. Our initial results were
encouraging, achieving an F1-score of 80.44%. This significantly outperforms
comparable methods in the literature, including conventional Extreme Gradient
Boosting (XGBoost) models, which reported an F1-score of 72.76%.

Abstract: Rare events such as financial crashes, climate extremes, and biological
anomalies are notoriously difficult to model due to their scarcity and
heavy-tailed distributions. Classical deep generative models often struggle to
capture these rare occurrences, either collapsing low-probability modes or
producing poorly calibrated uncertainty estimates. In this work, we propose the
Quantum-Enhanced Generative Model (QEGM), a hybrid classical-quantum framework
that integrates deep latent-variable models with variational quantum circuits.
The framework introduces two key innovations: (1) a hybrid loss function that
jointly optimizes reconstruction fidelity and tail-aware likelihood, and (2)
quantum randomness-driven noise injection to enhance sample diversity and
mitigate mode collapse. Training proceeds via a hybrid loop where classical
parameters are updated through backpropagation while quantum parameters are
optimized using parameter-shift gradients. We evaluate QEGM on synthetic
Gaussian mixtures and real-world datasets spanning finance, climate, and
protein structure. Results demonstrate that QEGM reduces tail KL divergence by
up to 50 percent compared to state-of-the-art baselines (GAN, VAE, Diffusion),
while improving rare-event recall and coverage calibration. These findings
highlight the potential of QEGM as a principled approach for rare-event
prediction, offering robustness beyond what is achievable with purely classical
methods.

Abstract: Bad charactors when submitting to arXiv: Attention is a fundamental building
block of large language models (LLMs), so there have been many efforts to
implement it efficiently. For example, FlashAttention leverages tiling and
kernel fusion to optimize attention. Recently, a number of variants of
attention have been introduced to enhance model quality or efficiency.
Supporting them efficiently remains difficult since they usually require
specialized kernels or hand-tuned implementations. FlexAttention recently
addressed part of this gap by using static programming templates to support
FlashAttention-like kernels for a subset of attention variants.
  In this paper, we introduce Flashlight, a compiler-native framework within
the PyTorch ecosystem that automatically generates fused, FlashAttention-style
kernels for arbitrary attention-based programs, without relying on static
templates or predefined kernel specializations. Flashlight leverages PyTorch's
compilation workflow to fuse and tile attention computations transparently,
enabling efficient execution for diverse attention patterns. Not only does it
support all variants expressible in the FlexAttention model but it also handles
more general, data-dependent attention formulations that are beyond the
capabilities of FlexAttention.
  Our results show that Flashlight produces kernels with competitive or
superior performance to FlexAttention, while offering the flexibility of native
PyTorch code, enabling developers to rapidly explore new attention models
without sacrificing performance.

Abstract: Fine-tuning LLMs for classification typically maps inputs directly to labels.
We ask whether attaching brief explanations to each label during fine-tuning
yields better models. We evaluate conversational response quality along three
axes: naturalness, comprehensiveness, and on-topic adherence, each rated on
5-point scales. Using ensemble-generated data from multiple LLMs, we fine-tune
a 7B-parameter model and test across six diverse conversational datasets.
Across 18 dataset, task settings, label-plus-explanation training outperforms
label-only baselines.
  A central and unexpected result concerns random tokens. We replace
human-written explanations with text that is syntactically incoherent yet
vocabulary-aligned with the originals (e.g., shuffled or bag-of-words
variants). Despite lacking semantics, these pseudo-explanations still improve
accuracy over label-only training and often narrow much of the gap to true
explanations. The effect persists across datasets and training seeds,
indicating that gains arise less from meaning than from structure: the extra
token budget encourages richer intermediate computation and acts as a
regularizer that reduces over-confident shortcuts.
  Internal analyses support this view: explanation-augmented models exhibit
higher activation entropy in intermediate layers alongside sharper predictive
mass at the output layer, consistent with increased deliberation before
decision. Overall, explanation-augmented fine-tuning, whether with genuine
rationales or carefully constructed random token sequences, improves accuracy
and reliability for LLM classification while clarifying how token-level
scaffolding shapes computation during inference.

Abstract: Objective gait analysis using wearable sensors and AI is critical for
managing neurological and orthopedic conditions. However, models are vulnerable
to hidden dataset biases, and task-specific sensor optimization remains a
challenge. We propose a multi-stream attention-based deep learning framework
that functions as both a sensor optimizer and an automated data auditor.
Applied to the Voisard et al. (2025) multi-cohort gait dataset on four clinical
tasks (PD, OA, CVA screening; PD vs CVA differential), the model's attention
mechanism quantitatively discovered a severe dataset confound. For OA and CVA
screening, tasks where bilateral assessment is clinically essential, the model
assigned more than 70 percent attention to the Right Foot while statistically
ignoring the Left Foot (less than 0.1 percent attention, 95 percent CI
[0.0-0.1]). This was not a clinical finding but a direct reflection of a severe
laterality bias (for example, 15 of 15 right-sided OA) in the public dataset.
The primary contribution of this work is methodological, demonstrating that an
interpretable framework can automatically audit dataset integrity. As a
secondary finding, the model proposes novel, data-driven sensor synergies (for
example, Head plus Foot for PD screening) as hypotheses for future optimized
protocols.

Abstract: Effectively leveraging prior knowledge of a system's physics is crucial for
applications of machine learning to scientific domains. Previous approaches
mostly focused on incorporating physical insights at the architectural level.
In this paper, we propose a framework to leverage physical information directly
into the loss function for prediction and generative modeling tasks on systems
like molecules and spins. We derive energy loss functions assuming that each
data sample is in thermal equilibrium with respect to an approximate energy
landscape. By using the reverse KL divergence with a Boltzmann distribution
around the data, we obtain the loss as an energy difference between the data
and the model predictions. This perspective also recasts traditional objectives
like MSE as energy-based, but with a physically meaningless energy. In
contrast, our formulation yields physically grounded loss functions with
gradients that better align with valid configurations, while being
architecture-agnostic and computationally efficient. The energy loss functions
also inherently respect physical symmetries. We demonstrate our approach on
molecular generation and spin ground-state prediction and report significant
improvements over baselines.

Abstract: Contrast-Consistent Search (CCS) is an unsupervised probing method able to
test whether large language models represent binary features, such as sentence
truth, in their internal activations. While CCS has shown promise, its two-term
objective has been only partially understood. In this work, we revisit CCS with
the aim of clarifying its mechanisms and extending its applicability. We argue
that what should be optimized for, is relative contrast consistency. Building
on this insight, we reformulate CCS as an eigenproblem, yielding closed-form
solutions with interpretable eigenvalues and natural extensions to multiple
variables. We evaluate these approaches across a range of datasets, finding
that they recover similar performance to CCS, while avoiding problems around
sensitivity to random initialization. Our results suggest that relativizing
contrast consistency not only improves our understanding of CCS but also opens
pathways for broader probing and mechanistic interpretability methods.

Abstract: The field of world modeling is fragmented, with researchers developing
bespoke architectures that rarely build upon each other. We propose a framework
that specifies the natural building blocks for structured world models based on
the fundamental stochastic processes that any world model must capture:
discrete processes (logic, symbols) and continuous processes (physics,
dynamics); the world model is then defined by the hierarchical composition of
these building blocks. We examine Hidden Markov Models (HMMs) and switching
linear dynamical systems (sLDS) as natural building blocks for discrete and
continuous modeling--which become partially-observable Markov decision
processes (POMDPs) and controlled sLDS when augmented with actions. This
modular approach supports both passive modeling (generation, forecasting) and
active control (planning, decision-making) within the same architecture. We
avoid the combinatorial explosion of traditional structure learning by largely
fixing the causal architecture and searching over only four depth parameters.
We review practical expressiveness through multimodal generative modeling
(passive) and planning from pixels (active), with performance competitive to
neural approaches while maintaining interpretability. The core outstanding
challenge is scalable joint structure-parameter learning; current methods
finesse this by cleverly growing structure and parameters incrementally, but
are limited in their scalability. If solved, these natural building blocks
could provide foundational infrastructure for world modeling, analogous to how
standardized layers enabled progress in deep learning.

machine wear-and-tear. ML models assume stationary distribution and fail to
maintain performance when encountered with such non-stationary data streams.
Online learning techniques have been leveraged in other domains, however it has
been largely unexplored for fusion applications. In this paper, we present an
application of online learning to continuously adapt to drifting data stream
for prediction of Toroidal Field (TF) coils deflection at the DIII-D fusion
facility. The results demonstrate that online learning is critical to maintain
ML model performance and reduces error by 80% compared to a static model.
Moreover, traditional online learning can suffer from short-term performance
degradation as ground truth is not available before making the predictions. As
such, we propose an uncertainty guided online ensemble method to further
improve the performance. The Deep Gaussian Process Approximation (DGPA)
technique is leveraged for calibrated uncertainty estimation and the
uncertainty values are then used to guide a meta-algorithm that produces
predictions based on an ensemble of learners trained on different horizon of
historical data. The DGPA also provides uncertainty estimation along with the
predictions for decision makers. The online ensemble and the proposed
uncertainty guided online ensemble reduces predictions error by about 6%, and
10% respectively over standard single model based online learning.

Abstract: Shapley data valuation provides a principled, axiomatic framework for
assigning importance to individual datapoints, and has gained traction in
dataset curation, pruning, and pricing. However, it is a combinatorial measure
that requires evaluating marginal utility across all subsets of the data,
making it computationally infeasible at scale. We propose a geometric
alternative based on statistical leverage scores, which quantify each
datapoint's structural influence in the representation space by measuring how
much it extends the span of the dataset and contributes to the effective
dimensionality of the training problem. We show that our scores satisfy the
dummy, efficiency, and symmetry axioms of Shapley valuation and that extending
them to \emph{ridge leverage scores} yields strictly positive marginal gains
that connect naturally to classical A- and D-optimal design criteria. We
further show that training on a leverage-sampled subset produces a model whose
parameters and predictive risk are within $O(\varepsilon)$ of the full-data
optimum, thereby providing a rigorous link between data valuation and
downstream decision quality. Finally, we conduct an active learning experiment
in which we empirically demonstrate that ridge-leverage sampling outperforms
standard baselines without requiring access gradients or backward passes.

Abstract: Within the context of representation learning for Earth observation,
geographic Implicit Neural Representations (INRs) embed low-dimensional
location inputs (longitude, latitude) into high-dimensional embeddings, through
models trained on geo-referenced satellite, image or text data. Despite the
common aim of geographic INRs to distill Earth's data into compact,
learning-friendly representations, we lack an understanding of how much
information is contained in these Earth representations, and where that
information is concentrated. The intrinsic dimension of a dataset measures the
number of degrees of freedom required to capture its local variability,
regardless of the ambient high-dimensional space in which it is embedded. This
work provides the first study of the intrinsic dimensionality of geographic
INRs. Analyzing INRs with ambient dimension between 256 and 512, we find that
their intrinsic dimensions fall roughly between 2 and 10 and are sensitive to
changing spatial resolution and input modalities during INR pre-training.
Furthermore, we show that the intrinsic dimension of a geographic INR
correlates with downstream task performance and can capture spatial artifacts,
facilitating model evaluation and diagnostics. More broadly, our work offers an
architecture-agnostic, label-free metric of information content that can enable
unsupervised evaluation, model selection, and pre-training design across INRs.

Abstract: In this paper we study how the choice of loss functions of non-convex
optimization problems affects their robustness and optimization landscape,
through the study of noisy matrix sensing. In traditional regression tasks,
mean squared error (MSE) loss is a common choice, but it can be unreliable for
non-Gaussian or heavy-tailed noise. To address this issue, we adopt a robust
loss based on nonparametric regression, which uses a kernel-based estimate of
the residual density and maximizes the estimated log-likelihood. This robust
formulation coincides with the MSE loss under Gaussian errors but remains
stable under more general settings. We further examine how this robust loss
reshapes the optimization landscape by analyzing the upper-bound of restricted
isometry property (RIP) constants for spurious local minima to disappear.
Through theoretical and empirical analysis, we show that this new loss excels
at handling large noise and remains robust across diverse noise distributions.
This work offers initial insights into enhancing the robustness of machine
learning tasks through simply changing the loss, guided by an intuitive and
broadly applicable analytical framework.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Variance-dependent regret bounds have received increasing attention in recent
studies on contextual bandits. However, most of these studies are focused on
upper confidence bound (UCB)-based bandit algorithms, while sampling based
bandit algorithms such as Thompson sampling are still understudied. The only
exception is the LinVDTS algorithm (Xu et al., 2023), which is limited to
linear reward function and its regret bound is not optimal with respect to the
model dimension. In this paper, we present FGTSVA, a variance-aware Thompson
Sampling algorithm for contextual bandits with general reward function with
optimal regret bound. At the core of our analysis is an extension of the
decoupling coefficient, a technique commonly used in the analysis of Feel-good
Thompson sampling (FGTS) that reflects the complexity of the model space. With
the new decoupling coefficient denoted by $\mathrm{dc}$, FGTS-VA achieves the
regret of
$\tilde{O}(\sqrt{\mathrm{dc}\cdot\log|\mathcal{F}|\sum_{t=1}^T\sigma_t^2}+\mathrm{dc})$,
where $|\mathcal{F}|$ is the size of the model space, $T$ is the total number
of rounds, and $\sigma_t^2$ is the subgaussian norm of the noise (e.g.,
variance when the noise is Gaussian) at round $t$. In the setting of contextual
linear bandits, the regret bound of FGTSVA matches that of UCB-based algorithms
using weighted linear regression (Zhou and Gu, 2022).

Abstract: Early identification of abnormal physiological patterns is essential for the
timely detection of cardiac disease. This work introduces a hybrid
quantum-classical convolutional neural network (QCNN) designed to classify S3
and murmur abnormalities in heart sound signals. The approach transforms
one-dimensional phonocardiogram (PCG) signals into compact two-dimensional
images through a combination of wavelet feature extraction and adaptive
threshold compression methods. We compress the cardiac-sound patterns into an
8-pixel image so that only 8 qubits are needed for the quantum stage.
Preliminary results on the HLS-CMDS dataset demonstrate 93.33% classification
accuracy on the test set and 97.14% on the train set, suggesting that quantum
models can efficiently capture temporal-spectral correlations in biomedical
signals. To our knowledge, this is the first application of a QCNN algorithm
for bioacoustic signal processing. The proposed method represents an early step
toward quantum-enhanced diagnostic systems for resource-constrained healthcare
environments.

Abstract: Drug synergy prediction is a critical task in the development of effective
combination therapies for complex diseases, including cancer. Although existing
methods have shown promising results, they often operate as black-box
predictors that rely predominantly on statistical correlations between drug
characteristics and results. To address this limitation, we propose CausalDDS,
a novel framework that disentangles drug molecules into causal and spurious
substructures, utilizing the causal substructure representations for predicting
drug synergy. By focusing on causal sub-structures, CausalDDS effectively
mitigates the impact of redundant features introduced by spurious
substructures, enhancing the accuracy and interpretability of the model. In
addition, CausalDDS employs a conditional intervention mechanism, where
interventions are conditioned on paired molecular structures, and introduces a
novel optimization objective guided by the principles of sufficiency and
independence. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method outperforms
baseline models, particularly in cold start and out-of-distribution settings.
Besides, CausalDDS effectively identifies key substructures underlying drug
synergy, providing clear insights into how drug combinations work at the
molecular level. These results underscore the potential of CausalDDS as a
practical tool for predicting drug synergy and facilitating drug discovery.

Abstract: Machine Learning (ML) models are extensively used in various applications due
to their significant advantages over traditional learning methods. However, the
developed ML models often underperform when deployed in the real world due to
the well-known distribution shift problem. This problem can lead to a
catastrophic outcomes when these decision-making systems have to operate in
high-risk applications. Many researchers have previously studied this problem
in ML, known as distribution shift problem, using statistical techniques (such
as Kullback-Leibler, Kolmogorov-Smirnov Test, Wasserstein distance, etc.) to
quantify the distribution shift. In this letter, we show that using
Characteristic Function (CF) as a frequency domain approach is a powerful
alternative for measuring the distribution shift in high-dimensional space and
for domain adaptation.

Abstract: Time series data is one of the most popular data modalities in critical
domains such as industry and medicine. The demand for algorithms that not only
exhibit high accuracy but also offer interpretability is crucial in such
fields, as decisions made there bear significant consequences. In this paper,
we present ProtoTSNet, a novel approach to interpretable classification of
multivariate time series data, through substantial enhancements to the
ProtoPNet architecture. Our method is tailored to overcome the unique
challenges of time series analysis, including capturing dynamic patterns and
handling varying feature significance. Central to our innovation is a modified
convolutional encoder utilizing group convolutions, pre-trainable as part of an
autoencoder and designed to preserve and quantify feature importance. We
evaluated our model on 30 multivariate time series datasets from the UEA
archive, comparing our approach with existing explainable methods as well as
non-explainable baselines. Through comprehensive evaluation and ablation
studies, we demonstrate that our approach achieves the best performance among
ante-hoc explainable methods while maintaining competitive performance with
non-explainable and post-hoc explainable approaches, providing interpretable
results accessible to domain experts.

Abstract: Accurate air quality forecasts are vital for public health alerts, exposure
assessment, and emissions control. In practice, observational data are often
missing in varying proportions and patterns due to collection and transmission
issues. These incomplete spatiotemporal records impede reliable inference and
risk assessment and can lead to overconfident extrapolation. To address these
challenges, we propose an end to end framework, the channel gated learning unit
based spatiotemporal bayesian neural field (CGLUBNF). It uses Fourier features
with a graph attention encoder to capture multiscale spatial dependencies and
seasonal temporal dynamics. A channel gated learning unit, equipped with
learnable activations and gated residual connections, adaptively filters and
amplifies informative features. Bayesian inference jointly optimizes predictive
distributions and parameter uncertainty, producing point estimates and
calibrated prediction intervals. We conduct a systematic evaluation on two real
world datasets, covering four typical missing data patterns and comparing
against five state of the art baselines. CGLUBNF achieves superior prediction
accuracy and sharper confidence intervals. In addition, we further validate
robustness across multiple prediction horizons and analysis the contribution of
extraneous variables. This research lays a foundation for reliable deep
learning based spatio-temporal forecasting with incomplete observations in
emerging sensing paradigms, such as real world vehicle borne mobile monitoring.

Abstract: Multimodal spatiotemporal learning on real-world experimental data is
constrained by two challenges: within-modality measurements are sparse,
irregular, and noisy (QA/QC artifacts) but cross-modally correlated; the set of
available modalities varies across space and time, shrinking the usable record
unless models can adapt to arbitrary subsets at train and test time. We propose
OmniField, a continuity-aware framework that learns a continuous neural field
conditioned on available modalities and iteratively fuses cross-modal context.
A multimodal crosstalk block architecture paired with iterative cross-modal
refinement aligns signals prior to the decoder, enabling unified
reconstruction, interpolation, forecasting, and cross-modal prediction without
gridding or surrogate preprocessing. Extensive evaluations show that OmniField
consistently outperforms eight strong multimodal spatiotemporal baselines.
Under heavy simulated sensor noise, performance remains close to clean-input
levels, highlighting robustness to corrupted measurements.

Abstract: Agents that understand objects and their interactions can learn policies that
are more robust and transferable. However, most object-centric RL methods
factor state by individual objects while leaving interactions implicit. We
introduce the Factored Interactive Object-Centric World Model (FIOC-WM), a
unified framework that learns structured representations of both objects and
their interactions within a world model. FIOC-WM captures environment dynamics
with disentangled and modular representations of object interactions, improving
sample efficiency and generalization for policy learning. Concretely, FIOC-WM
first learns object-centric latents and an interaction structure directly from
pixels, leveraging pre-trained vision encoders. The learned world model then
decomposes tasks into composable interaction primitives, and a hierarchical
policy is trained on top: a high level selects the type and order of
interactions, while a low level executes them. On simulated robotic and
embodied-AI benchmarks, FIOC-WM improves policy-learning sample efficiency and
generalization over world-model baselines, indicating that explicit, modular
interaction learning is crucial for robust control.

Abstract: An increasing number of LLMs employ Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architectures
where the feed-forward layer is replaced by a pool of experts and each token
only activates a small subset of them. During autoregressive generation, these
models often enter a memory-bound regime even for moderate batch sizes because
the average expert load grows more slowly than in an equivalent dense
feedforward layer. Consequently, MoE latency is governed by the number of
activated experts. We introduce a framework for dynamically re-routing
token-to-expert mapping to lower this number (and thus, the decode latency)
while preserving a comparable quality. Our best results use a batch-aware
routing that works by having tokens piggyback experts that have already been
loaded into memory due to being crucial to other tokens within the same batch.
Empirically, we evaluate our method on the Qwen3-30B and Qwen3-235B models with
a batch size of $16$. Without any statistically significant loss in accuracy,
our approach achieves latency reductions of $39\%$ and $15\%$ in the MoE layer
decode latency, respectively.

Abstract: Initialization of neural network parameters, such as weights and biases, has
a crucial impact on learning performance; if chosen well, we can even avoid the
need for additional training with backpropagation. For example, algorithms
based on the ridgelet transform or the SWIM (sampling where it matters) concept
have been proposed for initialization. On the other hand, it is well-known that
neural networks tend to learn coarse information in the earlier layers. The
feature is called spectral bias. In this work, we investigate the effects of
utilizing information on the spectral bias in the initialization of neural
networks. Hence, we propose a framework that adjusts the scale factors in the
SWIM algorithm to capture low-frequency components in the early-stage hidden
layers and to represent high-frequency components in the late-stage hidden
layers. Numerical experiments on a one-dimensional regression task and the
MNIST classification task demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms the
conventional initialization algorithms. This work clarifies the importance of
intrinsic spectral properties in learning neural networks, and the finding
yields an effective parameter initialization strategy that enhances their
training performance.

Abstract: Smoothness is known to be crucial for acceleration in offline optimization,
and for gradient-variation regret minimization in online learning.
Interestingly, these two problems are actually closely connected -- accelerated
optimization can be understood through the lens of gradient-variation online
learning. In this paper, we investigate online learning with H\"older smooth
functions, a general class encompassing both smooth and non-smooth (Lipschitz)
functions, and explore its implications for offline optimization. For
(strongly) convex online functions, we design the corresponding
gradient-variation online learning algorithm whose regret smoothly interpolates
between the optimal guarantees in smooth and non-smooth regimes. Notably, our
algorithms do not require prior knowledge of the H\"older smoothness parameter,
exhibiting strong adaptivity over existing methods. Through online-to-batch
conversion, this gradient-variation online adaptivity yields an optimal
universal method for stochastic convex optimization under H\"older smoothness.
However, achieving universality in offline strongly convex optimization is more
challenging. We address this by integrating online adaptivity with a
detection-based guess-and-check procedure, which, for the first time, yields a
universal offline method that achieves accelerated convergence in the smooth
regime while maintaining near-optimal convergence in the non-smooth one.

Abstract: Data assimilation (DA) has increasingly emerged as a critical tool for state
estimation
  across a wide range of applications. It is signiffcantly challenging when the
governing equations of the underlying dynamics are unknown. To this end,
various machine learning approaches have been employed to construct a surrogate
state transition
  model in a supervised learning framework, which relies on pre-computed
training
  datasets. However, it is often infeasible to obtain noise-free ground-truth
state sequences in practice. To address this challenge, we propose a novel
method that integrates reinforcement learning with ensemble-based Bayesian
ffltering methods, enabling
  the learning of surrogate state transition model for unknown dynamics
directly from noisy observations, without using true state trajectories.
Speciffcally, we treat the process for computing maximum likelihood estimation
of surrogate model parameters
  as a sequential decision-making problem, which can be formulated as a
discretetime
  Markov decision process (MDP). Under this formulation, learning the surrogate
transition model is equivalent to ffnding an optimal policy of the MDP, which
can be effectively addressed using reinforcement learning techniques. Once the
model is trained offfine, state estimation can be performed in the online stage
using ffltering methods based on the learned dynamics. The proposed framework
accommodates a wide range of observation scenarios, including nonlinear and
partially observed measurement
  models. A few numerical examples demonstrate that the proposed method
achieves superior accuracy and robustness in high-dimensional settings.

Abstract: The rapid growth of industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) systems has created
new challenges for anomaly detection in high-dimensional, multivariate
time-series, where privacy, scalability, and communication efficiency are
critical. Classical federated learning approaches mitigate privacy concerns by
enabling decentralized training, but they often struggle with highly non-linear
decision boundaries and imbalanced anomaly distributions. To address this gap,
we propose a Federated Quantum Kernel Learning (FQKL) framework that integrates
quantum feature maps with federated aggregation to enable distributed,
privacy-preserving anomaly detection across heterogeneous IoT networks. In our
design, quantum edge nodes locally compute compressed kernel statistics using
parameterized quantum circuits and share only these summaries with a central
server, which constructs a global Gram matrix and trains a decision function
(e.g., Fed-QSVM). Experimental results on synthetic IIoT benchmarks demonstrate
that FQKL achieves superior generalization in capturing complex temporal
correlations compared to classical federated baselines, while significantly
reducing communication overhead. This work highlights the promise of quantum
kernels in federated settings, advancing the path toward scalable, robust, and
quantum-enhanced intelligence for next-generation IoT infrastructures.

Abstract: Training large Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) models remains computationally
prohibitive due to their extreme compute and memory demands. Although
low-precision training promises to accelerate computation and reduce memory
footprint, existing implementations still rely on BF16-dominated dataflows with
frequent quantize-dequantize (Q/DQ) conversions. These redundant casts erode
much of FP8's theoretical efficiency. However, naively removing these casts by
keeping dataflows entirely in FP8 introduces double quantization error: tensors
quantized along different dimensions accumulate inconsistent scaling factors,
degrading numerical stability.
  We propose FP8-Flow-MoE, an FP8 training recipe featuring a
quantization-consistent FP8-centric dataflow with a scaling-aware transpose and
fused FP8 operators that streamline computation and eliminate explicit cast
operations from 12 to 2. Evaluations on a 671B-parameter MoE model demonstrate
up to 21\% higher throughput and 16.5 GB lower memory usage per GPU compared to
BF16 and na\"ive FP8 baselines, while maintaining stable convergence. We
provide a plug-and-play FP8 recipe compatible with TransformerEngine and
Megatron-LM, which will be open-sourced soon.

Abstract: We revisit test-time scaling for language model reasoning and ask a
fundamental question: at equal token budget and compute, is it better to run
multiple independent chains in parallel, or to run fewer chains that
iteratively refine through sequential steps? Through comprehensive evaluation
across 5 state-of-the-art open source models and 3 challenging reasoning
benchmarks, we find that sequential scaling where chains explicitly build upon
previous attempts consistently outperforms the dominant parallel
self-consistency paradigm in 95.6% of configurations with gains in accuracy
upto 46.7%. Further, we introduce inverse-entropy weighted voting, a novel
training-free method to further boost the accuracy of sequential scaling. By
weighing answers in proportion to the inverse entropy of their reasoning
chains, we increase our success rate over parallel majority and establish it as
the optimal test-time scaling strategy. Our findings fundamentally challenge
the parallel reasoning orthodoxy that has dominated test-time scaling since
Wang et al.'s self-consistency decoding (Wang et al., 2022), positioning
sequential refinement as the robust default for modern LLM reasoning and
necessitating a paradigm shift in how we approach inference-time optimization.

Abstract: Head-and-neck cancer (HNC) planning is difficult because multiple critical
organs-at-risk (OARs) are close to complex targets. Intensity-modulated
carbon-ion therapy (IMCT) offers superior dose conformity and OAR sparing but
remains slow due to relative biological effectiveness (RBE) modeling, leading
to laborious, experience-based, and often suboptimal tuning of many
treatment-planning parameters (TPPs). Recent deep learning (DL) methods are
limited by data bias and plan feasibility, while reinforcement learning (RL)
struggles to efficiently explore the exponentially large TPP search space. We
propose a scalable multi-agent RL (MARL) framework for parallel tuning of 45
TPPs in IMCT. It uses a centralized-training decentralized-execution (CTDE)
QMIX backbone with Double DQN, Dueling DQN, and recurrent encoding (DRQN) for
stable learning in a high-dimensional, non-stationary environment. To enhance
efficiency, we (1) use compact historical DVH vectors as state inputs, (2)
apply a linear action-to-value transform mapping small discrete actions to
uniform parameter adjustments, and (3) design an absolute, clinically informed
piecewise reward aligned with plan scores. A synchronous multi-process worker
system interfaces with the PHOENIX TPS for parallel optimization and
accelerated data collection. On a head-and-neck dataset (10 training, 10

Abstract: Mixed-Integer Linear Programming (MILP) is a fundamental and powerful
framework for modeling complex optimization problems across diverse domains.
Recently, learning-based methods have shown great promise in accelerating MILP
solvers by predicting high-quality solutions. However, most existing approaches
are developed and evaluated in single-domain settings, limiting their ability
to generalize to unseen problem distributions. This limitation poses a major
obstacle to building scalable and general-purpose learning-based solvers. To
address this challenge, we introduce RoME, a domain-Robust Mixture-of-Experts
framework for predicting MILP solutions across domains. RoME dynamically routes
problem instances to specialized experts based on learned task embeddings. The
model is trained using a two-level distributionally robust optimization
strategy: inter-domain to mitigate global shifts across domains, and
intra-domain to enhance local robustness by introducing perturbations on task
embeddings. We reveal that cross-domain training not only enhances the model's
generalization capability to unseen domains but also improves performance
within each individual domain by encouraging the model to capture more general
intrinsic combinatorial patterns. Specifically, a single RoME model trained on
three domains achieves an average improvement of 67.7% then evaluated on five
diverse domains. We further test the pretrained model on MIPLIB in a zero-shot
setting, demonstrating its ability to deliver measurable performance gains on
challenging real-world instances where existing learning-based approaches often
struggle to generalize.

Abstract: Predicting crimes in urban environments is crucial for public safety, yet
existing prediction methods often struggle to align the knowledge across
diverse cities that vary dramatically in data availability of specific crime
types. We propose HYpernetwork-enhanced Spatial Temporal Learning (HYSTL), a
framework that can effectively train a unified, stronger crime predictor
without assuming identical crime types in different cities' records. In HYSTL,
instead of parameterising a dedicated predictor per crime type, a hypernetwork
is designed to dynamically generate parameters for the prediction function
conditioned on the crime type of interest. To bridge the semantic gap between
different crime types, a structured crime knowledge graph is built, where the
learned representations of crimes are used as the input to the hypernetwork to
facilitate parameter generation. As such, when making predictions for each
crime type, the predictor is additionally guided by its intricate association
with other relevant crime types. Extensive experiments are performed on two
cities with non-overlapping crime types, and the results demonstrate HYSTL
outperforms state-of-the-art baselines.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Preconditioning is a key component of MCMC algorithms that improves sampling
efficiency by facilitating exploration of geometrically complex target
distributions through an invertible map. While linear preconditioners are often
sufficient for moderately complex target distributions, recent work has
explored nonlinear preconditioning with invertible neural networks as
components of normalizing flows (NFs). However, empirical and theoretical
studies show that overparameterized NF preconditioners can degrade sampling
efficiency and fit quality. Moreover, existing NF-based approaches do not adapt
their architectures to the target distribution. Related work outside of MCMC
similarly finds that suitably parameterized NFs can achieve comparable or
superior performance with substantially less training time or data. We propose
a factorized preconditioning architecture that reduces NF complexity by
combining a linear component with a conditional NF, improving adaptability to
target geometry. The linear preconditioner is applied to dimensions that are
approximately Gaussian, as estimated from warmup samples, while the conditional
NF models more complex dimensions. Our method yields significantly better tail
samples on two complex synthetic distributions and consistently better
performance on a sparse logistic regression posterior across varying likelihood
and prior strengths. It also achieves higher effective sample sizes on
hierarchical Bayesian model posteriors with weak likelihoods and strong funnel
geometries. This approach is particularly relevant for hierarchical Bayesian
model analyses with limited data and could inform current theoretical and
software strides in neural MCMC design.

Abstract: Graph neural networks have shown remarkable success in exploiting the spatial
and temporal patterns on dynamic graphs. However, existing GNNs exhibit poor
generalization ability under distribution shifts, which is inevitable in
dynamic scenarios. As dynamic graph generation progresses amid evolving latent
non-stationary environments, it is imperative to explore their effects on
out-of-distribution (OOD) generalization. This paper proposes a novel Evolving
Graph Learning framework for OOD generalization (EvoOOD) by environment-aware
invariant pattern recognition. Specifically, we first design an environment
sequential variational auto-encoder to model environment evolution and infer
the underlying environment distribution. Then, we introduce a mechanism for
environment-aware invariant pattern recognition, tailored to address
environmental diversification through inferred distributions. Finally, we
conduct fine-grained causal interventions on individual nodes using a mixture
of instantiated environment samples. This approach helps to distinguish
spatio-temporal invariant patterns for OOD prediction, especially in
non-stationary environments. Experimental results demonstrate the superiority
of EvoGOOD on both real-world and synthetic dynamic datasets under distribution
shifts. To the best of our knowledge, it is the first attempt to study the
dynamic graph OOD generalization problem from the environment evolution
perspective.

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has emerged as the dominant paradigm for
grounding large language model outputs in verifiable evidence. However, as
modern AI agents transition from static knowledge bases to continuous
multimodal streams encompassing text, images, video, and audio, two critical
challenges arise: maintaining index freshness without prohibitive re-indexing
costs, and preserving cross-modal semantic consistency across heterogeneous
embedding spaces. We present LUMA-RAG, a lifelong multimodal agent architecture
featuring three key innovations: (i) a streaming, multi-tier memory system that
dynamically spills embeddings from a hot HNSW tier to a compressed IVFPQ tier
under strict memory budgets; (ii) a streaming CLAP->CLIP alignment bridge that
maintains cross-modal consistency through incremental orthogonal Procrustes
updates; and (iii) stability-aware retrieval telemetry providing Safe@k
guarantees by jointly bounding alignment drift and quantization error.
Experiments demonstrate robust text-to-image retrieval (Recall@10 = 0.94),
graceful performance degradation under product quantization offloading, and
provably stable audio-to-image rankings (Safe@1 = 1.0), establishing LUMA-RAG
as a practical framework for production multimodal RAG systems.

Abstract: Early detection of heart arrhythmia can prevent severe future complications
in cardiac patients. While manual diagnosis still remains the clinical
standard, it relies heavily on visual interpretation and is inherently
subjective. In recent years, deep learning has emerged as a powerful tool to
automate arrhythmia detection, offering improved accuracy, consistency, and
efficiency. Several variants of convolutional and recurrent neural network
architectures have been widely explored to capture spatial and temporal
patterns in physiological signals. However, despite these advancements, current
models often struggle to generalize well in real-world scenarios, especially
when dealing with small or noisy datasets, which are common challenges in
biomedical applications. In this paper, a novel CNN-H-Infinity-LSTM
architecture is proposed to identify arrhythmic heart signals from heart sound
recordings. This architecture introduces trainable parameters inspired by the
H-Infinity filter from control theory, enhancing robustness and generalization.
Extensive experimentation on the PhysioNet CinC Challenge 2016 dataset, a
public benchmark of heart audio recordings, demonstrates that the proposed
model achieves stable convergence and outperforms existing benchmarks, with a
test accuracy of 99.42% and an F1 score of 98.85%.

Abstract: We present a novel decentralized algorithm for coverage control in unknown
spatial environments modeled by Gaussian Processes (GPs). To trade-off between
exploration and exploitation, each agent autonomously determines its trajectory
by minimizing a local cost function. Inspired by the GP-UCB (Upper Confidence
Bound for GPs) acquisition function, the proposed cost combines the expected
locational cost with a variance-based exploration term, guiding agents toward
regions that are both high in predicted density and model uncertainty. Compared
to previous work, our algorithm operates in a fully decentralized fashion,
relying only on local observations and communication with neighboring agents.
In particular, agents periodically update their inducing points using a greedy
selection strategy, enabling scalable online GP updates. We demonstrate the
effectiveness of our algorithm in simulation.

machine unlearning literature. This paper then introduces the concept of
feasible updates as the model's parameter update directions that help with
unlearning while not degrading the utility of the initial model. Our design of
feasible updates is based on masking, \ie\ a careful selection of the model's
parameters worth updating. It also takes into account the estimation noise of
the gradients when processing each batch of data to offer a statistical
guarantee to derive locally feasible updates. The technique can be plugged in,
as an add-on, to any first-order approximate unlearning methods. Experiments
with computer vision classifiers validate this approach.

Abstract: Machine learning methods are increasingly applied in medical imaging, yet
many reported improvements lack statistical robustness: recent works have
highlighted that small but significant performance gains are highly likely to
be false positives. However, these analyses do not take
\emph{underspecification} into account -- the fact that models achieving
similar validation scores may behave differently on unseen data due to random
initialization or training dynamics. Here, we extend a recent statistical
framework modeling false outperformance claims to include underspecification as
an additional variance component. Our simulations demonstrate that even modest
seed variability ($\sim1\%$) substantially increases the evidence required to
support superiority claims. Our findings underscore the need for explicit
modeling of training variance when validating medical imaging systems.

Abstract: Knowledge graph embedding (KGE) has become a fundamental technique for
representation learning on multi-relational data. Many seminal models, such as
TransE, operate in an unbounded Euclidean space, which presents inherent
limitations in modeling complex relations and can lead to inefficient training.
In this paper, we propose Spherical Knowledge Graph Embedding (SKGE), a model
that challenges this paradigm by constraining entity representations to a
compact manifold: a hypersphere. SKGE employs a learnable, non-linear
Spherization Layer to map entities onto the sphere and interprets relations as
a hybrid translate-then-project transformation. Through extensive experiments
on three benchmark datasets, FB15k-237, CoDEx-S, and CoDEx-M, we demonstrate
that SKGE consistently and significantly outperforms its strong Euclidean
counterpart, TransE, particularly on large-scale benchmarks such as FB15k-237
and CoDEx-M, demonstrating the efficacy of the spherical geometric prior. We
provide an in-depth analysis to reveal the sources of this advantage, showing
that this geometric constraint acts as a powerful regularizer, leading to
comprehensive performance gains across all relation types. More fundamentally,
we prove that the spherical geometry creates an "inherently hard negative
sampling" environment, naturally eliminating trivial negatives and forcing the
model to learn more robust and semantically coherent representations. Our
findings compellingly demonstrate that the choice of manifold is not merely an
implementation detail but a fundamental design principle, advocating for
geometric priors as a cornerstone for designing the next generation of powerful
and stable KGE models.

Abstract: Partial differential equations (PDEs) underpin quantitative descriptions
across the physical sciences and engineering, yet high-fidelity simulation
remains a major computational bottleneck for many-query, real-time, and design
tasks. Data-driven surrogates can be strikingly fast but are often unreliable
when applied outside their training distribution. Here we introduce Neural
Operator Warm Starts (NOWS), a hybrid strategy that harnesses learned solution
operators to accelerate classical iterative solvers by producing high-quality
initial guesses for Krylov methods such as conjugate gradient and GMRES. NOWS
leaves existing discretizations and solver infrastructures intact, integrating
seamlessly with finite-difference, finite-element, isogeometric analysis,
finite volume method, etc. Across our benchmarks, the learned initialization
consistently reduces iteration counts and end-to-end runtime, resulting in a
reduction of the computational time of up to 90 %, while preserving the
stability and convergence guarantees of the underlying numerical algorithms. By
combining the rapid inference of neural operators with the rigor of traditional
solvers, NOWS provides a practical and trustworthy approach to accelerate
high-fidelity PDE simulations.

Abstract: As the global burden of Alzheimer's disease (AD) continues to grow, early and
accurate detection has become increasingly critical, especially in regions with
limited access to advanced diagnostic tools. We propose BRAINS (Biomedical
Retrieval-Augmented Intelligence for Neurodegeneration Screening) to address
this challenge. This novel system harnesses the powerful reasoning capabilities
of Large Language Models (LLMs) for Alzheimer's detection and monitoring.
BRAINS features a dual-module architecture: a cognitive diagnostic module and a
case-retrieval module. The Diagnostic Module utilizes LLMs fine-tuned on
cognitive and neuroimaging datasets -- including MMSE, CDR scores, and brain
volume metrics -- to perform structured assessments of Alzheimer's risk.
Meanwhile, the Case Retrieval Module encodes patient profiles into latent
representations and retrieves similar cases from a curated knowledge base.
These auxiliary cases are fused with the input profile via a Case Fusion Layer
to enhance contextual understanding. The combined representation is then
processed with clinical prompts for inference. Evaluations on real-world
datasets demonstrate BRAINS effectiveness in classifying disease severity and
identifying early signs of cognitive decline. This system not only shows strong
potential as an assistive tool for scalable, explainable, and early-stage
Alzheimer's disease detection, but also offers hope for future applications in
the field.

Abstract: We propose a unified information-geometric framework that formalizes
understanding in learning as a trade-off between informativeness and geometric
simplicity. An encoder phi is evaluated by U(phi) = I(phi(X); Y) - beta *
C(phi), where C(phi) penalizes curvature and intrinsic dimensionality,
enforcing smooth, low-complexity manifolds. Under mild manifold and regularity
assumptions, we derive non-asymptotic bounds showing that generalization error
scales with intrinsic dimension while curvature controls approximation
stability, directly linking geometry to sample efficiency. To operationalize
this theory, we introduce the Variational Geometric Information Bottleneck
(V-GIB), a variational estimator that unifies mutual-information compression
and curvature regularization through tractable geometric proxies such as the
Hutchinson trace, Jacobian norms, and local PCA. Experiments across synthetic
manifolds, few-shot settings, and real-world datasets (Fashion-MNIST, CIFAR-10)
reveal a robust information-geometry Pareto frontier, stable estimators, and
substantial gains in interpretive efficiency. Fractional-data experiments on
CIFAR-10 confirm that curvature-aware encoders maintain predictive power under
data scarcity, validating the predicted efficiency-curvature law. Overall,
V-GIB provides a principled and measurable route to representations that are
geometrically coherent, data-efficient, and aligned with human-understandable
structure.

Abstract: The capacitated location-routing problems (CLRPs) are classical problems in
combinatorial optimization, which require simultaneously making location and
routing decisions. In CLRPs, the complex constraints and the intricate
relationships between various decisions make the problem challenging to solve.
With the emergence of deep reinforcement learning (DRL), it has been
extensively applied to address the vehicle routing problem and its variants,
while the research related to CLRPs still needs to be explored. In this paper,
we propose the DRL with heterogeneous query (DRLHQ) to solve CLRP and open CLRP
(OCLRP), respectively. We are the first to propose an end-to-end learning
approach for CLRPs, following the encoder-decoder structure. In particular, we
reformulate the CLRPs as a markov decision process tailored to various
decisions, a general modeling framework that can be adapted to other DRL-based
methods. To better handle the interdependency across location and routing
decisions, we also introduce a novel heterogeneous querying attention mechanism
designed to adapt dynamically to various decision-making stages. Experimental
results on both synthetic and benchmark datasets demonstrate superior solution
quality and better generalization performance of our proposed approach over
representative traditional and DRL-based baselines in solving both CLRP and
OCLRP.

Abstract: Healthcare artificial intelligence systems routinely fail when deployed
across institutions, with documented performance drops and perpetuation of
discriminatory patterns embedded in historical data. This brittleness stems, in
part, from learning statistical associations rather than causal mechanisms.
Causal graph neural networks address this triple crisis of distribution shift,
discrimination, and inscrutability by combining graph-based representations of
biomedical data with causal inference principles to learn invariant mechanisms
rather than spurious correlations. This Review examines methodological
foundations spanning structural causal models, disentangled causal
representation learning, and techniques for interventional prediction and
counterfactual reasoning on graphs. We analyse applications demonstrating
clinical value across psychiatric diagnosis through brain network analysis,
cancer subtyping via multi-omics causal integration, continuous physiological
monitoring with mechanistic interpretation, and drug recommendation correcting
prescription bias. These advances establish foundations for patient-specific
Causal Digital Twins, enabling in silico clinical experimentation, with
integration of large language models for hypothesis generation and causal graph
neural networks for mechanistic validation. Substantial barriers remain,
including computational requirements precluding real-time deployment,
validation challenges demanding multi-modal evidence triangulation beyond
cross-validation, and risks of causal-washing where methods employ causal
terminology without rigorous evidentiary support. We propose tiered frameworks
distinguishing causally-inspired architectures from causally-validated
discoveries and identify critical research priorities making causal rather than
purely associational claims.

Abstract: We investigate theoretical guarantees for the false-negative rate (FNR) --
the fraction of true causal edges whose orientation is not recovered, under
single-variable random interventions and an $\epsilon$-interventional
faithfulness assumption that accommodates latent confounding. For sparse
Erd\H{o}s--R\'enyi directed acyclic graphs, where the edge probability scales
as $p_e = \Theta(1/d)$, we show that the FNR concentrates around its mean at
rate $O(\frac{\log d}{\sqrt d})$, implying that large deviations above the
expected error become exponentially unlikely as dimensionality increases. This
concentration ensures that derived upper bounds hold with high probability in
large-scale settings. Extending the analysis to generalized Barab\'asi--Albert
graphs reveals an even stronger phenomenon: when the degree exponent satisfies
$\gamma > 3$, the deviation width scales as $O(d^{\beta - \frac{1}{2}})$ with
$\beta = 1/(\gamma - 1) < \frac{1}{2}$, and hence vanishes in the limit. This
demonstrates that realistic scale-free topologies intrinsically regularize
causal discovery, reducing variability in orientation error. These
finite-dimension results provide the first dimension-adaptive,
faithfulness-robust guarantees for causal structure recovery, and challenge the
intuition that high dimensionality and network heterogeneity necessarily hinder
accurate discovery. Our simulation results corroborate these theoretical
predictions, showing that the FNR indeed concentrates and often vanishes in
practice as dimensionality grows.

Abstract: Offline reinforcement learning (RL) suffers from extrapolation errors induced
by out-of-distribution (OOD) actions. To address this, offline RL algorithms
typically impose constraints on action selection, which can be systematically
categorized into density, support, and sample constraints. However, we show
that each category has inherent limitations: density and sample constraints
tend to be overly conservative in many scenarios, while the support constraint,
though least restrictive, faces challenges in accurately modeling the behavior
policy. To overcome these limitations, we propose a new neighborhood constraint
that restricts action selection in the Bellman target to the union of
neighborhoods of dataset actions. Theoretically, the constraint not only bounds
extrapolation errors and distribution shift under certain conditions, but also
approximates the support constraint without requiring behavior policy modeling.
Moreover, it retains substantial flexibility and enables pointwise conservatism
by adapting the neighborhood radius for each data point. In practice, we employ
data quality as the adaptation criterion and design an adaptive neighborhood
constraint. Building on an efficient bilevel optimization framework, we develop
a simple yet effective algorithm, Adaptive Neighborhood-constrained Q learning
(ANQ), to perform Q learning with target actions satisfying this constraint.
Empirically, ANQ achieves state-of-the-art performance on standard offline RL
benchmarks and exhibits strong robustness in scenarios with noisy or limited
data.

Abstract: Hyperparameter optimization (HPO), for example, based on Bayesian
optimization (BO), supports users in designing models well-suited for a given
dataset. HPO has proven its effectiveness on several applications, ranging from
classical machine learning for tabular data to deep neural networks for
computer vision and transformers for natural language processing. However, HPO
still sometimes lacks acceptance by machine learning experts due to its
black-box nature and limited user control. Addressing this, first approaches
have been proposed to initialize BO methods with expert knowledge. However,
these approaches do not allow for online steering during the optimization
process. In this paper, we introduce a novel method that enables repeated
interventions to steer BO via user input, specifying expert knowledge and user
preferences at runtime of the HPO process in the form of prior distributions.
To this end, we generalize an existing method, $\pi$BO, preserving theoretical
guarantees. We also introduce a misleading prior detection scheme, which allows
protection against harmful user inputs. In our experimental evaluation, we
demonstrate that our method can effectively incorporate multiple priors,
leveraging informative priors, whereas misleading priors are reliably rejected
or overcome. Thereby, we achieve competitiveness to unperturbed BO.

Abstract: Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) is widely regarded as one of the most
successful deep reinforcement learning algorithms, known for its robustness and
effectiveness across a range of problems.
  The PPO objective encourages the importance ratio between the current and
behavior policies to move to the "right" direction -- starting from importance
sampling ratios equal to 1, increasing the ratios for actions with positive
advantages and decreasing those with negative advantages. A clipping function
is introduced to prevent over-optimization when updating the importance ratio
in these "right" direction regions. Many PPO variants have been proposed to
extend its success, most of which modify the objective's behavior by altering
the clipping in the "right" direction regions. However, due to randomness in
the rollouts and stochasticity of the policy optimization, we observe that the
ratios frequently move to the "wrong" direction during the PPO optimization.
This is a key factor hindering the improvement of PPO, but it has been largely
overlooked. To address this, we propose the Directional-Clamp PPO algorithm
(DClamp-PPO), which further penalizes the actions going to the strict "wrong"
direction regions, where the advantage is positive (negative) and importance
ratio falls below (above) $1 - \beta$ ($1+\beta$),
  for a tunable parameter $\beta \in (0, 1)$. The penalty is by enforcing a
steeper loss slope, i.e., a clamp, in those regions. We demonstrate that
DClamp-PPO consistently outperforms PPO, as well as its variants, by focusing
on modifying the objective's behavior in the "right" direction, across various
MuJoCo environments, using different random seeds. The proposed method is
shown, both theoretically and empirically, to better avoid "wrong" direction
updates while keeping the importance ratio closer to 1.

Abstract: We introduce Omega^2, a Large Language Model-driven framework for corporate
credit scoring that combines structured financial data with advanced machine
learning to improve predictive reliability and interpretability. Our study
evaluates Omega^2 on a multi-agency dataset of 7,800 corporate credit ratings
drawn from Moody's, Standard & Poor's, Fitch, and Egan-Jones, each containing
detailed firm-level financial indicators such as leverage, profitability, and
liquidity ratios. The system integrates CatBoost, LightGBM, and XGBoost models
optimized through Bayesian search under temporal validation to ensure
forward-looking and reproducible results. Omega^2 achieved a mean test AUC
above 0.93 across agencies, confirming its ability to generalize across rating
systems and maintain temporal consistency. These results show that combining
language-based reasoning with quantitative learning creates a transparent and
institution-grade foundation for reliable corporate credit-risk assessment.

Abstract: The development of smart systems (i.e., systems enhanced with AI components)
has thrived thanks to the rapid advancements in neural networks (NNs). A wide
range of libraries and frameworks have consequently emerged to support NN
design and implementation. The choice depends on factors such as available
functionalities, ease of use, documentation and community support. After
adopting a given NN framework, organizations might later choose to switch to
another if performance declines, requirements evolve, or new features are
introduced. Unfortunately, migrating NN implementations across libraries is
challenging due to the lack of migration approaches specifically tailored for
NNs. This leads to increased time and effort to modernize NNs, as manual
updates are necessary to avoid relying on outdated implementations and ensure
compatibility with new features. In this paper, we propose an approach to
automatically migrate neural network code across deep learning frameworks. Our
method makes use of a pivot NN model to create an abstraction of the NN prior
to migration. We validate our approach using two popular NN frameworks, namely
PyTorch and TensorFlow. We also discuss the challenges of migrating code
between the two frameworks and how they were approached in our method.
Experimental evaluation on five NNs shows that our approach successfully
migrates their code and produces NNs that are functionally equivalent to the
originals. Artefacts from our work are available online.

Abstract: Idempotent Generative Networks (IGNs) are deep generative models that also
function as local data manifold projectors, mapping arbitrary inputs back onto
the manifold. They are trained to act as identity operators on the data and as
idempotent operators off the data manifold. However, IGNs suffer from mode
collapse, mode dropping, and training instability due to their objectives,
which contain adversarial components and can cause the model to cover the data
manifold only partially -- an issue shared with generative adversarial
networks. We introduce Non-Adversarial Idempotent Generative Networks (NAIGNs)
to address these issues. Our loss function combines reconstruction with the
non-adversarial generative objective of Implicit Maximum Likelihood Estimation
(IMLE). This improves on IGN's ability to restore corrupted data and generate
new samples that closely match the data distribution. We moreover demonstrate
that NAIGNs implicitly learn the distance field to the data manifold, as well
as an energy-based model.

Abstract: We study computable probably approximately correct (CPAC) learning, where
learners are required to be computable functions. It had been previously
observed that the Fundamental Theorem of Statistical Learning, which
characterizes PAC learnability by finiteness of the Vapnik-Chervonenkis
(VC-)dimension, no longer holds in this framework. Recent works recovered
analogs of the Fundamental Theorem in the computable setting, for instance by
introducing an effective VC-dimension. Guided by this, we investigate the
connection between CPAC learning and recursively enumerable representable (RER)
classes, whose members can be algorithmically listed. Our results show that the
effective VC-dimensions can take arbitrary values above the traditional one,
even for RER classes, which creates a whole family of (non-)examples for
various notions of CPAC learning. Yet the two dimensions coincide for classes
satisfying sufficiently strong notions of CPAC learning. We then observe that
CPAC learnability can also be characterized via containment of RER classes that
realize the same samples. Furthermore, it is shown that CPAC learnable classes
satisfying a unique identification property are necessarily RER. Finally, we
establish that agnostic learnability can be guaranteed for RER classes, by
considering the relaxed notion of nonuniform CPAC learning.

Abstract: We introduce GasRL, a simulator that couples a calibrated representation of
the natural gas market with a model of storage-operator policies trained with
deep reinforcement learning (RL). We use it to analyse how optimal stockpile
management affects equilibrium prices and the dynamics of demand and supply. We
test various RL algorithms and find that Soft Actor Critic (SAC) exhibits
superior performance in the GasRL environment: multiple objectives of storage
operators - including profitability, robust market clearing and price
stabilisation - are successfully achieved. Moreover, the equilibrium price
dynamics induced by SAC-derived optimal policies have characteristics, such as
volatility and seasonality, that closely match those of real-world prices.
Remarkably, this adherence to the historical distribution of prices is obtained
without explicitly calibrating the model to price data. We show how the
simulator can be used to assess the effects of EU-mandated minimum storage
thresholds. We find that such thresholds have a positive effect on market
resilience against unanticipated shifts in the distribution of supply shocks.
For example, with unusually large shocks, market disruptions are averted more
often if a threshold is in place.

server in the presence of Byzantine adversaries capable of arbitrary and

efficiency and robustness against such adversaries, we propose a
Byzantine-resilient Nesterov-Accelerated Federated Learning (Byrd-NAFL)
algorithm. Byrd-NAFL seamlessly integrates Nesterov's momentum into the
federated learning process alongside Byzantine-resilient aggregation rules to
achieve fast and safeguarding convergence against gradient corruption. We
establish a finite-time convergence guarantee for Byrd-NAFL under non-convex
and smooth loss functions with relaxed assumption on the aggregated gradients.
Extensive numerical experiments validate the effectiveness of Byrd-NAFL and
demonstrate the superiority over existing benchmarks in terms of convergence
speed, accuracy, and resilience to diverse Byzantine attack strategies.

Abstract: Focusing on implicit neural representations, we present a novel in situ
training protocol that employs limited memory buffers of full and sketched data
samples, where the sketched data are leveraged to prevent catastrophic
forgetting. The theoretical motivation for our use of sketching as a
regularizer is presented via a simple Johnson-Lindenstrauss-informed result.
While our methods may be of wider interest in the field of continual learning,
we specifically target in situ neural compression using implicit neural
representation-based hypernetworks. We evaluate our method on a variety of
complex simulation data in two and three dimensions, over long time horizons,
and across unstructured grids and non-Cartesian geometries. On these tasks, we
show strong reconstruction performance at high compression rates. Most
importantly, we demonstrate that sketching enables the presented in situ scheme
to approximately match the performance of the equivalent offline method.

Abstract: Compositional generalization-a key open challenge in modern machine
learning-requires models to predict unknown combinations of known concepts.
However, assessing compositional generalization remains a fundamental challenge
due to the lack of standardized evaluation protocols and the limitations of
current benchmarks, which often favor efficiency over rigor. At the same time,
general-purpose vision architectures lack the necessary inductive biases, and
existing approaches to endow them compromise scalability. As a remedy, this
paper introduces: 1) a rigorous evaluation framework that unifies and extends
previous approaches while reducing computational requirements from
combinatorial to constant; 2) an extensive and modern evaluation on the status
of compositional generalization in supervised vision backbones, training more
than 5000 models; 3) Attribute Invariant Networks, a class of models
establishing a new Pareto frontier in compositional generalization, achieving a
23.43% accuracy improvement over baselines while reducing parameter overhead
from 600% to 16% compared to fully disentangled counterparts.

Abstract: Training agents to operate under strict constraints during deployment, such
as limited resource budgets or stringent safety requirements, presents
significant challenges, especially when these constraints render the task
complex. In this work, we propose a curriculum learning strategy that gradually
tightens constraints during training, enabling the agent to incrementally
master the deployment requirements. Inspired by self-paced learning techniques
in unconstrained reinforcement learning (RL), our approach facilitates a
smoother transition to challenging environments by initially training on
simplified versions of the constraints and progressively introducing the full
deployment conditions. We provide a theoretical analysis using an RL agent in a
binary-tree Markov Decision Process (MDP) to demonstrate that our curriculum
strategy can accelerate training relative to a baseline approach that imposes
the trajectory constraints from the outset. Moreover, we empirically validate
the effectiveness and generality of our method across both RL and large
language model (LLM) agents in diverse settings, including a binary-tree MDP, a
multi-task navigation domain, and a math reasoning task with two benchmarks.
These results highlight the potential of curriculum design in enhancing the
efficiency and performance of agents operating under complex trajectory
constraints during deployment. Moreover, when applied to LLMs, our strategy
enables compression of output chain-of-thought tokens, achieving a substantial
inference speedup on consumer hardware, demonstrating its effectiveness for
resource-constrained deployment.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Knowledge tracing (KT) models are a crucial basis for pedagogical
decision-making, namely which task to select next for a learner and when to
stop teaching a particular skill. Given the high stakes of pedagogical
decisions, KT models are typically required to be interpretable, in the sense
that they should implement an explicit model of human learning and provide
explicit estimates of learners' abilities. However, to our knowledge, no study
to date has investigated whether the interpretability of KT models actually
helps human teachers to make teaching decisions. We address this gap. First, we
perform a simulation study to show that, indeed, decisions based on
interpretable KT models achieve mastery faster compared to decisions based on a
non-interpretable model. Second, we repeat the study but ask $N=12$ human
teachers to make the teaching decisions based on the information provided by KT
models. As expected, teachers rate interpretable KT models higher in terms of
usability and trustworthiness. However, the number of tasks needed until
mastery hardly differs between KT models. This suggests that the relationship
between model interpretability and teacher decisions is not straightforward:
teachers do not solely rely on KT models to make decisions and further research
is needed to investigate how learners and teachers actually understand and use
KT models.

Abstract: Mislabeled data is a pervasive issue that undermines the performance of
machine learning systems in real-world applications. An effective approach to
mitigate this problem is to detect mislabeled instances and subject them to
special treatment, such as filtering or relabeling. Automatic mislabeling
detection methods typically rely on training a base machine learning model and
then probing it for each instance to obtain a trust score that each provided
label is genuine or incorrect. The properties of this base model are thus of
paramount importance. In this paper, we investigate the impact of calibrating
this model. Our empirical results show that using calibration methods improves
the accuracy and robustness of mislabeled instance detection, providing a
practical and effective solution for industrial applications.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Zeroth-order or derivative-free optimization (MeZO) is an attractive strategy
for finetuning large language models (LLMs) because it eliminates the memory
overhead of backpropagation. However, it converges slowly due to the inherent
curse of dimensionality when searching for descent directions in the
high-dimensional parameter space of billion-scale LLMs. We propose ConMeZO, a
novel zeroth-order optimizer that accelerates convergence by adaptive
directional sampling. Instead of drawing the direction uniformly at random,
ConMeZO restricts the sampling to a cone centered around a momentum estimate.
This concentrates the search in directions where the true gradient is more
likely to lie and thus reduces the effect of high dimensions. We prove that
ConMeZO achieves the same worst-case convergence rate as MeZO. Empirically,
when finetuning LLMs on natural language tasks, ConMeZO is up to 2X faster than
MeZO while retaining the low-memory footprint of zeroth-order methods.

Abstract: Training a team of agents from scratch in multi-agent reinforcement learning
(MARL) is highly inefficient, much like asking beginners to play a symphony
together without first practicing solo. Existing methods, such as offline or
transferable MARL, can ease this burden, but they still rely on costly
multi-agent data, which often becomes the bottleneck. In contrast, solo
experiences are far easier to obtain in many important scenarios, e.g.,
collaborative coding, household cooperation, and search-and-rescue. To unlock
their potential, we propose Solo-to-Collaborative RL (SoCo), a framework that
transfers solo knowledge into cooperative learning. SoCo first pretrains a
shared solo policy from solo demonstrations, then adapts it for cooperation
during multi-agent training through a policy fusion mechanism that combines an
MoE-like gating selector and an action editor. Experiments across diverse
cooperative tasks show that SoCo significantly boosts the training efficiency
and performance of backbone algorithms. These results demonstrate that solo
demonstrations provide a scalable and effective complement to multi-agent data,
making cooperative learning more practical and broadly applicable.

Abstract: Recently, the ChannelComp framework has proposed digital over-the-air
computation by designing digital modulations that enable the computation of
arbitrary functions. Unlike traditional analog over-the-air computation, which
is restricted to nomographic functions, ChannelComp enables a broader range of
computational tasks while maintaining compatibility with digital communication
systems. This framework is intended for applications that favor local
information processing over the mere acquisition of data. However, ChannelComp
is currently designed for scalar function computation, while numerous
data-centric applications necessitate vector-based computations, and it is
susceptible to channel fading. In this work, we introduce a generalization of
the ChannelComp framework, called VecComp, by integrating ChannelComp with
multiple-antenna technology. This generalization not only enables vector
function computation but also ensures scalability in the computational
complexity, which increases only linearly with the vector dimension. As such,
VecComp remains computationally efficient and robust against channel
impairments, making it suitable for high-dimensional, data-centric
applications. We establish a non-asymptotic upper bound on the mean squared
error of VecComp, affirming its computation efficiency under fading channel
conditions. Numerical experiments show the effectiveness of VecComp in
improving the computation of vector functions and fading compensation over
noisy and fading multiple-access channels.

Abstract: The chemical space of drug-like molecules is vast, motivating the development
of generative models that must learn broad chemical distributions, enable
conditional generation by capturing structure-property representations, and
provide fast molecular generation. Meeting the objectives depends on modeling
choices, including the probabilistic modeling approach, the conditional
generative formulation, the architecture, and the molecular input
representation. To address the challenges, we present STAR-VAE
(Selfies-encoded, Transformer-based, AutoRegressive Variational Auto Encoder),
a scalable latent-variable framework with a Transformer encoder and an
autoregressive Transformer decoder. It is trained on 79 million drug-like
molecules from PubChem, using SELFIES to guarantee syntactic validity. The
latent-variable formulation enables conditional generation: a property
predictor supplies a conditioning signal that is applied consistently to the
latent prior, the inference network, and the decoder. Our contributions are:
(i) a Transformer-based latent-variable encoder-decoder model trained on
SELFIES representations; (ii) a principled conditional latent-variable
formulation for property-guided generation; and (iii) efficient finetuning with
low-rank adapters (LoRA) in both encoder and decoder, enabling fast adaptation
with limited property and activity data. On the GuacaMol and MOSES benchmarks,
our approach matches or exceeds baselines, and latent-space analyses reveal
smooth, semantically structured representations that support both unconditional
exploration and property-aware generation. On the Tartarus benchmarks, the
conditional model shifts docking-score distributions toward stronger predicted
binding. These results suggest that a modernized, scale-appropriate VAE remains
competitive for molecular generation when paired with principled conditioning
and parameter-efficient finetuning.

Abstract: Despite the popularity of the Adam optimizer in practice, most theoretical
analyses study Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) as a proxy for Adam, and
little is known about how the solutions found by Adam differ. In this paper, we
show that Adam implicitly reduces a unique form of sharpness measure shaped by
its adaptive updates, leading to qualitatively different solutions from SGD.
More specifically, when the training loss is small, Adam wanders around the
manifold of minimizers and takes semi-gradients to minimize this sharpness
measure in an adaptive manner, a behavior we rigorously characterize through a
continuous-time approximation using stochastic differential equations. We
further demonstrate how this behavior differs from that of SGD in a
well-studied setting: when training overparameterized models with label noise,
SGD has been shown to minimize the trace of the Hessian matrix, $\tr(\mH)$,
whereas we prove that Adam minimizes $\tr(\Diag(\mH)^{1/2})$ instead. In
solving sparse linear regression with diagonal linear networks, this
distinction enables Adam to achieve better sparsity and generalization than
SGD. Finally, our analysis framework extends beyond Adam to a broad class of
adaptive gradient methods, including RMSProp, Adam-mini, Adalayer and Shampoo,
and provides a unified perspective on how these adaptive optimizers reduce
sharpness, which we hope will offer insights for future optimizer design.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Federated learning (FL) is a widely used method for training machine learning
(ML) models in a scalable way while preserving privacy (i.e., without
centralizing raw data). Prior research shows that the risk of exposing
sensitive data increases cumulatively as the number of iterations where a
client's updates are included in the aggregated model increase. Attackers can
launch membership inference attacks (MIA; deciding whether a sample or client
participated), property inference attacks (PIA; inferring attributes of a
client's data), and model inversion attacks (MI; reconstructing inputs),
thereby inferring client-specific attributes and, in some cases, reconstructing
inputs. In this paper, we mitigate risk by substantially reducing per client
exposure using a quantum computing-inspired quadratic unconstrained binary
optimization (QUBO) formulation that selects a small subset of client updates
most relevant for each training round. In this work, we focus on two threat
vectors: (i) information leakage by clients during training and (ii)
adversaries who can query or obtain the global model. We assume a trusted
central server and do not model server compromise. This method also assumes
that the server has access to a validation/test set with global data
distribution. Experiments on the MNIST dataset with 300 clients in 20 rounds
showed a 95.2% per-round and 49% cumulative privacy exposure reduction, with
147 clients' updates never being used during training while maintaining in
general the full-aggregation accuracy or even better. The method proved to be
efficient at lower scale and more complex model as well. A CINIC-10
dataset-based experiment with 30 clients resulted in 82% per-round privacy
improvement and 33% cumulative privacy.

Abstract: We present a systematic study of subtraction in large language models (LLMs).
While prior benchmarks emphasize addition and multiplication, subtraction has
received comparatively little attention despite being structurally distinct as
a non-commutative operation. We evaluate eight pretrained LLMs spanning four
families on addition and subtraction problems. Our experiments reveal that
subtraction accuracy lags behind addition by a wide margin. We find that the
errors for ($a-b$) are concentrated in cases where ($a<b$). In such cases, LLMs
frequently produce the correct magnitude but omit the negative sign. Probing
analyses show that LLMs internally encode whether results should be negative,
yet this information is often not reflected in generated outputs. We further
test well-known techniques such as few-shot learning and instruction-tuning to
see if they can improve the LLMs' performance. Our results suggest that while
few-shot prompting yields modest gains, the instruction-tuned models achieve
near-perfect accuracies in generating the negative sign. Together, these
findings provide a clearer characterization of the limitations and
recoverability of LLMs' arithmetic capabilities in subtraction.

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) is a distributed training paradigm wherein
participants collaborate to build a global model while ensuring the privacy of
the involved data, which remains stored on participant devices. However,
proposals aiming to ensure such privacy also make it challenging to protect
against potential attackers seeking to compromise the training outcome. In this
context, we present Fast, Private, and Protected (FPP), a novel approach that
aims to safeguard federated training while enabling secure aggregation to
preserve data privacy. This is accomplished by evaluating rounds using
participants' assessments and enabling training recovery after an attack. FPP
also employs a reputation-based mechanism to mitigate the participation of
attackers. We created a dockerized environment to validate the performance of
FPP compared to other approaches in the literature (FedAvg, Power-of-Choice,
and aggregation via Trimmed Mean and Median). Our experiments demonstrate that
FPP achieves a rapid convergence rate and can converge even in the presence of
malicious participants performing model poisoning attacks.

Abstract: Tabular foundation models represent a growing paradigm in structured data

However, their adoption remains limited due to heterogeneous preprocessing

absence of standardized evaluation for deployment-oriented metrics such as
calibration and fairness. We present TabTune, a unified library that
standardizes the complete workflow for tabular foundation models through a

models supporting multiple adaptation strategies, including zero-shot
inference, meta-learning, supervised fine-tuning (SFT), and parameter-efficient
fine-tuning (PEFT). The framework automates model-aware preprocessing, manages
architectural heterogeneity internally, and integrates evaluation modules for
performance, calibration, and fairness. Designed for extensibility and
reproducibility, TabTune enables consistent benchmarking of adaptation
strategies of tabular foundation models. The library is open source and
available at https://github.com/Lexsi-Labs/TabTune .

Abstract: In Major League Baseball, strategy and planning are major factors in
determining the outcome of a game. Previous studies have aided this by building
machine learning models for predicting the winning team of any given game. We
extend this work by training a comprehensive set of machine learning models
using a common dataset. In addition, we relate the win probabilities produced
by these models to win strength as measured by score differential. In doing so
we show that the most common machine learning models do indeed demonstrate a
relationship between predicted win probability and the strength of the win.
Finally, we analyze the results of using predicted win probabilities as a
decision making mechanism on run-line betting. We demonstrate positive returns
when utilizing appropriate betting strategies, and show that naive use of
machine learning models for betting lead to significant loses.

Abstract: The number and diversity of remote sensing satellites grows over time, while
the vast majority of labeled data comes from older satellites. As the
foundation models for Earth observation scale up, the cost of (re-)training to
support new satellites grows too, so the generalization capabilities of the
models towards new satellites become increasingly important. In this work we
introduce GeoCrossBench, an extension of the popular GeoBench benchmark with a
new evaluation protocol: it tests the in-distribution performance;
generalization to satellites with no band overlap; and generalization to
satellites with additional bands with respect to the training set. We also
develop a self-supervised extension of ChannelViT, ChiViT, to improve its
cross-satellite performance. First, we show that even the best foundation
models for remote sensing (DOFA, TerraFM) do not outperform general purpose
models like DINOv3 in the in-distribution setting. Second, when generalizing to
new satellites with no band overlap, all models suffer 2-4x drop in
performance, and ChiViT significantly outperforms the runner-up DINOv3. Third,
the performance of all tested models drops on average by 5-25\% when given
additional bands during test time. Finally, we show that fine-tuning just the
last linear layer of these models using oracle labels from all bands can get
relatively consistent performance across all satellites, highlighting that the
benchmark is far from being saturated. We publicly release the code and the
datasets to encourage the development of more future-proof remote sensing
models with stronger cross-satellite generalization.

Abstract: We present the first-ever global simulation of the full Earth system at
\qty{1.25}{\kilo\meter} grid spacing, achieving highest time compression with
an unseen number of degrees of freedom. Our model captures the flow of energy,
water, and carbon through key components of the Earth system: atmosphere,
ocean, and land. To achieve this landmark simulation, we harness the power of
\num{8192} GPUs on Alps and \num{20480} GPUs on JUPITER, two of the world's
largest GH200 superchip installations. We use both the Grace CPUs and Hopper
GPUs by carefully balancing Earth's components in a heterogeneous setup and
optimizing acceleration techniques available in ICON's codebase. We show how
separation of concerns can reduce the code complexity by half while increasing
performance and portability. Our achieved time compression of 145.7 simulated
days per day enables long studies including full interactions in the Earth
system and even outperforms earlier atmosphere-only simulations at a similar
resolution.

Abstract: Tropical cyclone-induced coastal hazards can significantly damage coastal
infrastructure, and these risks may intensify under future climate change. As a
result, there is increasing interest in conducting comprehensive assessments of
coastal hazards-including storm surge, storm wind, storm rainfall, and their
combined impacts-associated with tropical cyclone events. Risk assessments that
overlook the compounding nature of these hazards may lead to ineffective or
insufficient mitigation strategies. This study seeks to identify and evaluate
the available data, models, and methodologies for assessing both individual and
compound typhoon-induced hazards in South Korea. Particular effort is devoted
to exploring how established approaches from the North Atlantic region can be
adapted, integrated, and extended for application in the South Korean context.
Multiple sites across South Korea are analyzed to illustrate the strengths and
limitations of these methods.
